# Whip Kick Swimming Technique

The whip kick, also known as the breaststroke kick, is a common swimming technique used in the breaststroke. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform it:

## 1. Initial Position
- Start in a streamlined position with your body flat and your legs extended straight behind you.
- Keep your feet together and your toes pointed.

## 2. Bend the Knees
- Start the kick by bending your knees and bringing your heels towards your buttocks.
- Keep your thighs in the same position and your knees not too far apart, roughly hip-width.

## 3. Turn Out the Feet
- Once your heels are close to your buttocks, start turning your feet outward, preparing for the propulsive phase of the kick.

## 4. Propulsive Phase
- Extend your legs sideways and backwards in a circular, whip-like motion.
- Your feet should be flexed during this phase, with the soles of your feet pushing against the water for maximum propulsion.
- The legs come back together with your feet pointed, and you return to the initial streamlined position.

## 5. Timing
- The whip kick is typically synchronized with the arm strokes in the breaststroke.
- As your arms extend forward in the glide phase, your legs should be performing the whip kick.

## 6. Practice
- Practice the whip kick separately by using a kickboard or holding onto the pool's edge.
- Initially, you may find it helpful to exaggerate the circular motion of the kick until you get the feel for it.
- As you become more proficient, the movement will become more efficient and less wide.

## Note
The whip kick requires a good deal of flexibility in the hips and ankles. If you're finding the whip kick challenging, you may need to work on improving your flexibility. Also, remember that it's a technique that requires a bit of practice to master, so be patient with yourself and keep practicing.

# Breaststroke Arm Technique

The breaststroke arm technique is an essential part of the breaststroke swimming style. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform it:

## 1. Initial Position
- Begin in a streamlined position with your body flat and your arms extended straight in front of you, shoulder-width apart.
- Your palms should be facing down, and your fingers should be close together.

## 2. Outward Sweep
- Start the arm movement by bending your elbows and sweeping your hands outwards in a semicircular motion.
- Keep your fingers together and palms facing outwards.
- At the end of the sweep, your arms should form a 'Y' shape with your body, with elbows slightly bent and hands wider than your shoulders.

## 3. Inward Sweep
- Once your hands reach the widest point of the outward sweep, rotate your palms inward to face your body.
- Begin the inward sweep by bringing your hands back towards each other, maintaining a slight bend in your elbows.
- Your hands should stay below the surface of the water and below your chest throughout the inward sweep.

## 4. Recovery Phase
- At the end of the inward sweep, your hands should come together just below your chest.
- Quickly shoot your hands forward, extending your arms back to the initial streamlined position.
- Keep your hands close to the surface of the water during the recovery phase to minimize drag.

## 5. Timing
- The arm movements should be synchronized with the whip kick in the breaststroke.
- As your arms are extending forward in the glide phase, your legs should perform the whip kick.
- Glide for a moment with your arms extended and your legs together before starting the next arm stroke and kick.

## 6. Breathing
- Inhale during the inward sweep as your head naturally rises above the water.
- Exhale during the recovery phase and the beginning of the next outward sweep, as your head goes back underwater.

## 7. Practice
- Work on the arm technique separately by using a pull buoy to isolate your upper body.
- Focus on maintaining a smooth, continuous arm movement and coordinating it with your breathing.
- As you become more comfortable with the arm technique, start incorporating the whip kick to practice the full breaststroke.

By practicing the breaststroke arm technique regularly, you'll improve your efficiency and speed in the water. Remember, patience and consistency are key to mastering this swimming style.

## Practicing Breaststroke
Body position: Start by floating in a horizontal position with your face down in the water, arms extended in front of you, and legs straight behind you. Your body should be streamlined.

Arm pull: Begin the arm pull by bending your elbows and moving your hands outward in a circular motion. Keep your fingers together and your hands flat. As your hands move apart, maintain a 90-degree angle at the elbow joint. The pull should be powerful but not too wide. The wider the pull, the more resistance you create.

Recovery and glide: As your hands reach the widest point of the arm pull, start bringing them back towards the center of your body, close to your chest. Your elbows should be close to your ribcage. Once your hands are close to your chest, extend your arms straight out in front of you, returning to the starting position. Glide for a moment in this streamlined position.

Whip kick: As your arms are recovering and extending forward, begin the whip kick. Bend your knees and bring your heels towards your buttocks. Rotate your feet outwards, and then kick with both legs in a circular motion, like a frog kick. Make sure to keep your feet flexed throughout the kick.

Timing: Timing is crucial in breaststroke. As you extend your arms forward into the glide, your legs should be finishing the kick. This coordinated movement will help you maintain a streamlined position and move more efficiently through the water.

Breathing: During the arm pull phase, lift your head slightly out of the water to take a quick breath. Exhale as you extend your arms forward and return your face to the water. Make sure your head follows the natural body movement to avoid straining your neck.

Breaststroke is a graceful yet efficient swimming stroke that requires precise timing, body positioning, and coordination. By understanding and rectifying these common errors, you'll be well on your way to improving your breaststroke technique and becoming a more proficient swimmer. Let's dive in!

Mistake: Incorrect Body Position

Many swimmers tend to swim with their hips too low, causing their legs to drag and creating unnecessary resistance.
Another common mistake is keeping the head too high, which leads to a misalignment of the body and inefficient propulsion.
Fix:

To correct the body position, focus on keeping your hips higher in the water. Imagine your body forming a straight line from your head to your hips, with your legs floating near the surface.
Keep your head in a neutral position, aligned with your body. Look forward and slightly downward to maintain proper body alignment.
Mistake: Scissor Kick

A common mistake swimmers make in breaststroke is using a scissor kick instead of a proper whip kick.
Scissoring the legs creates excessive drag, slows down forward momentum, and leads to inefficient propulsion.
Fix:

Master the whip kick technique. Start by bringing your heels towards your glutes, keeping your knees close together.
Initiate the kick by quickly extending your legs backward and outward in a circular motion, similar to a frog kick. Finish the kick by bringing your feet together.
Focus on generating power from your hips and core muscles rather than relying solely on your legs.
Mistake: Overreaching Arm Pull

Many swimmers tend to overreach their arm pull, which causes excessive resistance and slows down the stroke rhythm.
Overreaching can also strain the shoulder joint and lead to inefficient propulsion.
Fix:

Maintain a relaxed and natural arm extension. Instead of overreaching, focus on bringing your hands forward in a slightly wider path, forming a diamond shape.
Initiate the arm pull by bending your elbows and bringing your hands towards your chest.
As your hands reach your chest, push them out and away from your body in a powerful and circular motion, propelling yourself forward.
Mistake: Improper Breathing Technique

In breaststroke, incorrect breathing technique often results in disrupted rhythm and unnecessary energy expenditure.
Some swimmers lift their heads too high, causing the hips to drop and creating additional resistance.
Fix:

Time your breath with your arm recovery. As your arms begin to extend forward after the pull, lift your head slightly above the water.
Breathe in quickly through your mouth, aiming to keep the movement smooth and uninterrupted.
Lower your head back into the water as your hands start their powerful push phase.
Mistake: Insufficient Glide and Timing

Many swimmers rush through the breaststroke, failing to take advantage of the gliding phase and compromising overall efficiency.
Poor timing between the pull, kick, and breathing can disrupt the stroke rhythm.
Fix:

Emphasize a strong glide after each arm pull and leg kick. Stretch your body forward, keeping it streamlined, and allow yourself to glide for a brief moment.
Work on timing the arm pull, kick, and breathing to create a smooth and continuous motion. Practice the stroke rhythm and coordination through repetition and drills.

Body Position Drill:

Swim with a kickboard, focusing on maintaining a high body position with hips near the water's surface.
Keep your head aligned with your body, looking slightly downward. Avoid lifting it too high.
Whip Kick Drill:

Practice the whip kick motion using a kickboard or with your arms extended forward.
Initiate the kick by bringing your heels towards your glutes, then quickly extend your legs outward and backward in a circular motion.
Focus on generating power from your hips and core muscles.
Arm Pull Correction Drill:

Swim breaststroke with a pull buoy placed between your legs.
Concentrate on maintaining a relaxed and natural arm extension, avoiding overreaching.
Focus on a powerful and circular arm pull, propelling yourself forward without excessive resistance.
Breathing Technique Drill:

Swim breaststroke with a snorkel or using a pull buoy to eliminate the need for breathing.
Practice the correct timing of your breath by lifting your head slightly above the water during the arm recovery phase.
Breathe in quickly and smoothly through your mouth, then lower your head back into the water as your hands start the push phase.
Timing and Rhythm Drill:

Swim breaststroke while emphasizing a strong glide after each arm pull and leg kick.
Count your strokes and kicks to develop a sense of rhythm and coordination.
Practice maintaining a steady and consistent timing between the arm pull, kick, and breathing.
