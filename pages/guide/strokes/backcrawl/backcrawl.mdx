# Back Crawl

1. Body Position: Start by lying on your back in the water with your face towards the ceiling or sky. Keep your body in a straight line from head to toe, with your hips and shoulders aligned.

2. Arm Stroke: Begin by bending your elbow and bringing your arm down towards your hip while keeping your hand close to your body. As your arm moves down, rotate your palm outwards and sweep your arm back up to the starting position above your head, rotating your palm inwards. Alternate arms with each stroke.

Tip: Keep your arms relaxed and use a smooth, fluid motion to conserve energy and maintain momentum.

3. Leg Kick: Keep your legs straight and close together, and alternate kicking up and down with each stroke of your arms. The up-kick should be small and quick, and the down-kick should be powerful and propelling.

Tip: Keep your kicks steady and rhythmic, and avoid over-kicking or splashing excessively, as this can slow you down.

4. Breathing: Breathe continuously in a natural and comfortable rhythm. Try to exhale continuously through your mouth and nose while underwater to avoid holding your breath and feeling tense.

5. Body Position: Maintain a high and flat body position in the water, keeping your hips and shoulders in line and your face up towards the ceiling or sky. Avoid lifting your head or chin too high, as this will cause your hips to sink and slow down your swimming.

Tip: Try to keep your body as relaxed and streamlined as possible, with minimal resistance to the water.

6. Practice: The back crawl takes practice to perfect, so take it slowly and focus on mastering each movement. Use a kickboard or pull buoy to isolate the arms or legs for extra practice.

Tip: Experiment with different tempos and stroke rates to find the most comfortable and efficient pace for you.
