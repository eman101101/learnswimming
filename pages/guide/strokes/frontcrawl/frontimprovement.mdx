# Improving Front Crawl

### Breathing
Struggle: Many swimmers have difficulty timing their breaths and coordinating them with their strokes. They may lift their head too high or turn it too far, causing their body to sink or become unbalanced.

Solution: Encourage swimmers to practice bilateral breathing, which involves breathing on both sides during the front crawl. This helps to maintain balance in the water. They should also focus on turning their head to the side just enough to allow one goggle to remain submerged, keeping their mouth close to the water's surface.

## Body Position:
Struggle: Swimmers may have a low or sinking body position, causing increased drag and making it more difficult to maintain a steady pace.

Solution: Teach swimmers to keep their body position horizontal by pressing their chest slightly downward, engaging their core, and keeping their head in a neutral position. This reduces drag and conserves energy.

## Kicking:
Struggle: Some swimmers may kick too hard, leading to fatigue or an unbalanced stroke. Others may not kick enough, resulting in inefficient propulsion.

Solution: Encourage swimmers to practice a steady, controlled flutter kick. They should use their hips and maintain a slight knee bend while keeping their ankles flexible. This will help them generate power and maintain a balanced stroke.

## Arm Pull:
Struggle: Swimmers often have trouble coordinating their arm movements, leading to inefficient propulsion and wasted energy.

Solution: Teach the "S-curve" pull, where the swimmer's hand enters the water, extending forward with fingertips pointing downward. As the hand catches the water, the arm bends at the elbow, pulling the water down and back. Finally, the hand exits the water by the hip, preparing for the recovery phase. Swimmers should also focus on keeping their elbows high during the pull.

## Recovery:
Struggle: Many swimmers struggle with an efficient recovery phase, either due to a wide arm swing or dropping their elbow too low.

Solution: Emphasize a relaxed, high-elbow recovery. The swimmer should keep their fingertips close to the water's surface and lead the recovery with their elbow. This minimizes drag and sets them up for an effective entry and catch.

## Timing and Coordination:
Struggle: Swimmers may have difficulty coordinating their arm and leg movements, leading to an inefficient stroke and wasted energy.

Solution: Teach swimmers the importance of a smooth, continuous stroke cycle. The catch phase of one arm should begin as the other arm starts its recovery phase. Kicking should be steady and maintain a consistent rhythm throughout the entire stroke cycle.

To help swimmers improve their front crawl technique, regularly provide feedback and drills that target specific areas of struggle. Over time, they will build the necessary muscle memory and coordination to swim the front crawl with ease and efficiency.
