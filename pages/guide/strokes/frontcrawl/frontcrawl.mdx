# Front Crawl

1. Body Position: Start in a horizontal position in the water with your arms extended in front of you and your face in the water. Keep your body as streamlined as possible with your legs straight and your toes pointed.

Tip: Engage your core muscles to maintain a straight line from head to toe and minimize drag.

2. Leg Kick: Kick your legs in a flutter kick motion, keeping them close together and your feet just below the surface of the water. Focus on generating a continuous, propulsive movement with each kick.

Tip: Keep your knees relatively straight and your ankles relaxed, allowing your feet to flex slightly to increase the surface area of the kick.

3. Arm Stroke: Pull your arms through the water in an alternating motion, keeping your elbow high and your hand close to your body. Rotate your body slightly to the side as you pull your arm through the water to generate more power and momentum.

Tip: Use a high elbow catch to maximize the amount of water you can pull with each stroke.

4. Arm Recovery: Recover your arm by bringing it out of the water and across your body towards your opposite hip. Keep your movements efficient and streamlined to minimize resistance to the water.

Tip: Try to keep your hand close to your body during the recovery phase to reduce drag.

5. Breathing: Breathe regularly by turning your head to the side as your arm pulls through the water. Inhale through your mouth and exhale through your nose and mouth as your face returns to the water.

Tip: Time your breathing with your arm stroke to maintain a smooth, rhythmic pattern.

6. Rhythm: Maintain a smooth and steady rhythm, maximizing the power of each arm and leg movement. Remember, the key to the front crawl is to maintain a smooth and steady rhythm, keeping your body as streamlined as possible, and generating maximum power with each arm and leg movement.

Tip: Experiment with different stroke rates and tempos to find the most efficient and comfortable pace for you.
