# Front Crawl

The front crawl, also known as freestyle, is widely regarded as the most crucial stroke to master in swimming. It serves as the cornerstone for other strokes and offers swimmers a versatile and effective technique. The front crawl is also the fastest stroke, making it a popular choice for competitive swimmers. It's important to learn the proper technique for front crawl to maximize efficiency and minimize the risk of injury.

## Front Crawl Arms

**Understand the Movements**: The front crawl arm movement consists of three main stages: The Catch, The Pull, and The Recovery. It's important to understand these before you begin.

- The Catch: This is when your hand first enters the water, fingers pointing straight down, with your palm facing backwards. 

- The Pull: From the catch position, bend your elbow and start to pull downwards, then backwards, "pulling" the water behind you.

- The Recovery: After the pull, your hand exits the water, leading with your elbow. This is the "recovery" phase, where your arm swings forward in the air to start another stroke.

**Practice Dry-Land Drills**: Before hopping into the water, it can be helpful to do some dry-land drills. Practice the movement of your arms by lying flat on your stomach on a bed or sofa, with your arms extended in front of you. Slowly go through the catch, pull, and recovery phases, paying attention to the movement of your elbows and shoulders.

**Begin with One Arm**: Once you're in the water, it might be easier to start with one arm at a time. Kick off from the wall of the pool, then use only one arm to practice the strokes. Try to visualize the movements you practiced on dry land. Keep doing this until you feel comfortable with the stroke.

**Switch Arms**: After mastering the stroke with one arm, switch to the other. Repeat the same process, making sure to keep your strokes smooth and consistent.

**Put it Together**: Once you've got the hang of the movements with each arm individually, it's time to combine them. The movement should be alternated, with one arm starting the catch phase as the other begins recovery. Imagine your arms operating like the arms of a clock, with one always opposite the other.

**Maintain a Steady Pace**: With both arms working together, focus on maintaining a steady, rhythmic pace. Each arm should be moving continuously, in a smooth, cyclical motion. Think of it like an ongoing relay race, where one arm always picks up where the other leaves off.

**Get Feedback**: As you're learning, it can be incredibly helpful to have someone watch you and provide feedback. If possible, consider getting a coach or an experienced swimmer to observe your technique. They can help you identify any mistakes and correct them before they become bad habits.

## Learning Front Crawl

Body Position: Maintain a flat and horizontal position in the water. Your body should be as streamlined as possible to reduce resistance when swimming.

Leg Kick: Using Flutter kick, your legs should be extended fully and kept relatively close together. Kick from the hip, not the knee, and keep your ankles loose.

Arm Movement: The arm movement in front crawl is alternating, meaning one arm is always moving while the other is stationary. The movement can be broken down into four parts: the reach, the catch, the pull, and the recovery.

Breathing: In front crawl, you breathe to the side during the recovery of one arm. It's important to turn your head to the side and exhale underwater before turning to inhale.

Timing: The timing in front crawl is crucial. The leg kick and arm movement should be synchronized to make the stroke efficient.

## Improving Front Crawl

**Breathing**

Many swimmers have difficulty timing their breaths and coordinating them with their strokes. They may lift their head too high or turn it too far, causing their body to sink or become unbalanced.

Practice bilateral breathing, which involves breathing on both sides during the front crawl. This helps maintain balance in the water. They should also focus on turning their head to the side just enough to allow one goggle to remain submerged, keeping their mouth close to the water's surface.

**Side Glide - Breathing Drill**

Push off the wall in a horizontal position on one side, with the lower arm extended and the upper arm resting on the body. Keep the face in the water and practice turning the head to breathe while maintaining a streamlined position.

**3/5/7 Strokes Breathing - Breathing Drill**

Alternate taking breaths every 3, 5, and 7 strokes to practice bilateral breathing and improve breath control. Push off the wall in a horizontal position on one side, with the lower arm extended and the upper arm resting on the body. Keep the face in the water and practice turning the head to breathe while maintaining a streamlined position.

**Body Position**

If you have a low or sinking body position, causing increased drag and making it more difficult to maintain a steady pace.

Keep your body position horizontal by pressing their chest slightly downward, engaging their core, and keeping their head in a neutral position. This reduces drag and conserves energy.

**Superman Glide - Body Position Drill**

Push off the wall in a streamlined position with arms extended in front, focusing on maintaining a horizontal body position. Glide as far as possible while engaging the core and keeping the head in a neutral position.

**Kick on Side - Body Position Drill**

With fins on, kick on one side while keeping the lower arm extended and the upper arm resting on the body. Focus on maintaining a horizontal body position and engaging the core. Switch sides after each lap.

**Kicking**

Make sure you practice a steady, controlled flutter kick. They should use their hips and maintain a slight knee bend while keeping their ankles flexible. This will help them generate power and maintain a balanced stroke.

**Vertical Kicking - Kicking Drill**

In the deep end, perform a flutter kick while keeping the body vertical and arms crossed on the chest. Maintain a consistent rhythm and kick from the hips.

**Flutter Kick with Board - Kicking Drill**

Hold a kickboard in front of the body with arms extended, focusing on a steady, controlled flutter kick. Keep the legs close together and kick from the hips.

**Arm Pull**

Swimmers often have trouble coordinating their arm movements, leading to inefficient propulsion and wasted energy. You can learn the "S-curve" pull, where the swimmer's hand enters the water, extending forward with fingertips pointing downward. As the hand catches the water, the arm bends at the elbow, pulling the water down and back. Finally, the hand exits the water by the hip, preparing for the recovery phase. Swimmers should also focus on keeping their elbows high during the pull.

**Single-Arm Drill - Arm Pull Drill**

Swim the front crawl using only one arm while keeping the other arm extended in front. Focus on the S-curve pull and high-elbow catch. Use a pull buoy or kickboard to help with balance. Switch arms after each lap.

**Catch-Up Drill - Arm Pull Drill**

Start with both arms extended in front. Begin the pull with one arm and only start the pull with the other arm once the first arm has returned to the front. This drill emphasizes the catch and pull phases of the stroke.

**Recovery**

Many swimmers struggle with an efficient recovery phase, either due to a wide arm swing or dropping their elbow too low.

Focus on a relaxed, high-elbow recovery. The swimmer should keep their fingertips close to the water's surface and lead the recovery with their elbow. This minimizes drag and sets them up for an effective entry and catch.

**Zipper Drill - Recovery Drill**

During the recovery phase, imagine zipping up a jacket by dragging the thumb along the side of the body and keeping the elbow high. This promotes a high-elbow recovery and reduces drag.

**Fingertip Drag - Recovery Drill**

During the recovery phase, keep the fingertips close to the water's surface and lead the recovery with the elbow. This drill ensures a relaxed, high-elbow recovery.

**Timing and Coordination**

Swimmers may have difficulty coordinating their arm and leg movements, leading to an inefficient stroke and wasted energy.

Focus on having a smooth, continuous stroke cycle. The catch phase of one arm should begin as the other arm starts its recovery phase. Kicking should be steady and maintain a consistent rhythm throughout the entire stroke cycle.

**6-Kick Switch - Timing and Coordination Drill**

Perform six kicks on one side with the lower arm extended and the upper arm resting on the body. After six kicks, take a stroke and switch sides, focusing on maintaining a continuous stroke cycle and rhythm.

**Sculling - Timing and Coordination Drill**

Using a pull buoy or kickboard between the legs, perform small sculling motions with the hands to maintain a steady forward movement. This drill helps develop a sense of timing and feel for the water.
