# Front Crawl

The front crawl stroke, also known as freestyle, is often considered the most important stroke to learn in swimming. It serves as a foundation for other strokes and provides swimmers with a versatile and efficient technique. Mastering the front crawl requires a strong emphasis on the kicking technique. The kick provides stability, balance, and propulsion in the water, allowing swimmers to maintain a streamlined body position and generate forward momentum. By ensuring that the kicking technique is good before learning the front crawl, swimmers can establish a solid foundation and develop a strong kick that will support their overall stroke mechanics. This approach enables swimmers to build a strong and efficient swimming technique, setting the stage for further progress and success in the water.

1. Body Position: Start in a horizontal position in the water with your arms extended in front of you and your face in the water. Maintain a streamlined body position with straight legs and pointed toes.

Tip: Engage your core muscles to maintain a straight line from head to toe, minimizing drag.

2. Leg Kick: Execute a flutter kick by continuously kicking your legs in a quick and rhythmic motion. Keep your legs close together, with your feet just below the water's surface.

Tip: Maintain relatively straight knees and relaxed ankles, allowing for slight flexion to increase the surface area of your kick.

3. Arm Stroke: Perform the arm stroke in an alternating fashion. As one arm pulls through the water, the other arm recovers above the water. Keep your elbow high during the pull phase, and rotate your body slightly to the side to generate more power.

Tip: Utilize a high elbow catch to maximize water propulsion with each stroke.

4. Arm Recovery: Efficiently recover your arm by smoothly bringing it out of the water and across your body towards the opposite hip. Maintain a streamlined and efficient motion to minimize resistance.

Tip: Keep your hand close to your body during the recovery phase to reduce drag.

5. Breathing: Incorporate regular breathing into your front crawl by turning your head to the side as your arm pulls through the water. Inhale through your mouth and exhale through your nose and mouth as your face returns to the water.

Tip: Coordinate your breathing with your arm stroke to maintain a smooth and rhythmic pattern.

6. Rhythm: Maintain a steady and consistent rhythm, optimizing the power of each arm and leg movement. Remember to prioritize a smooth and streamlined body position, generating maximum power with every stroke.

Tip: Experiment with different stroke rates and tempos to find the most efficient and comfortable pace for your swimming.

# Improving Front Crawl

### Breathing
Struggle: Many swimmers have difficulty timing their breaths and coordinating them with their strokes. They may lift their head too high or turn it too far, causing their body to sink or become unbalanced.

Solution: Encourage swimmers to practice bilateral breathing, which involves breathing on both sides during the front crawl. This helps to maintain balance in the water. They should also focus on turning their head to the side just enough to allow one goggle to remain submerged, keeping their mouth close to the water's surface.

## Body Position:
Struggle: Swimmers may have a low or sinking body position, causing increased drag and making it more difficult to maintain a steady pace.

Solution: Teach swimmers to keep their body position horizontal by pressing their chest slightly downward, engaging their core, and keeping their head in a neutral position. This reduces drag and conserves energy.

## Kicking:
Struggle: Some swimmers may kick too hard, leading to fatigue or an unbalanced stroke. Others may not kick enough, resulting in inefficient propulsion.

Solution: Encourage swimmers to practice a steady, controlled flutter kick. They should use their hips and maintain a slight knee bend while keeping their ankles flexible. This will help them generate power and maintain a balanced stroke.

## Arm Pull:
Struggle: Swimmers often have trouble coordinating their arm movements, leading to inefficient propulsion and wasted energy.

Solution: Teach the "S-curve" pull, where the swimmer's hand enters the water, extending forward with fingertips pointing downward. As the hand catches the water, the arm bends at the elbow, pulling the water down and back. Finally, the hand exits the water by the hip, preparing for the recovery phase. Swimmers should also focus on keeping their elbows high during the pull.

## Recovery:
Struggle: Many swimmers struggle with an efficient recovery phase, either due to a wide arm swing or dropping their elbow too low.

Solution: Emphasize a relaxed, high-elbow recovery. The swimmer should keep their fingertips close to the water's surface and lead the recovery with their elbow. This minimizes drag and sets them up for an effective entry and catch.

## Timing and Coordination:
Struggle: Swimmers may have difficulty coordinating their arm and leg movements, leading to an inefficient stroke and wasted energy.

Solution: Teach swimmers the importance of a smooth, continuous stroke cycle. The catch phase of one arm should begin as the other arm starts its recovery phase. Kicking should be steady and maintain a consistent rhythm throughout the entire stroke cycle.

To help swimmers improve their front crawl technique, regularly provide feedback and drills that target specific areas of struggle. Over time, they will build the necessary muscle memory and coordination to swim the front crawl with ease and efficiency.

**Breathing Drills:**
- Side Glide: Push off the wall in a horizontal position on one side, with the lower arm extended and the upper arm resting on the body. Keep the face in the water and practice turning the head to breathe while maintaining a streamlined position.
- 3/5/7 Strokes Breathing: Alternate taking breaths every 3, 5, and 7 strokes to practice bilateral breathing and improve breath control.

**Body Position Drills:**
- Superman Glide: Push off the wall in a streamlined position with arms extended in front, focusing on maintaining a horizontal body position. Glide as far as possible while engaging the core and keeping the head in a neutral position.
- Kick on Side: With fins on, kick on one side while keeping the lower arm extended and the upper arm resting on the body. Focus on maintaining a horizontal body position and engaging the core. Switch sides after each lap.

**Kicking Drills:**
- Vertical Kicking: In the deep end, perform a flutter kick while keeping the body vertical and arms crossed on the chest. Maintain a consistent rhythm and kick from the hips.
- Flutter Kick with Board: Hold a kickboard in front of the body with arms extended, focusing on a steady, controlled flutter kick. Keep the legs close together and kick from the hips.

**Arm Pull Drills:**
- Single-Arm Drill: Swim the front crawl using only one arm while keeping the other arm extended in front. Focus on the S-curve pull and high-elbow catch. Use a pull buoy or kickboard to help with balance. Switch arms after each lap.
- Catch-Up Drill: Start with both arms extended in front. Begin the pull with one arm and only start the pull with the other arm once the first arm has returned to the front. This drill emphasizes the catch and pull phases of the stroke.

**Recovery Drills:**
- Zipper Drill: During the recovery phase, imagine zipping up a jacket by dragging the thumb along the side of the body and keeping the elbow high. This promotes a high-elbow recovery and reduces drag.
- Fingertip Drag: During the recovery phase, keep the fingertips close to the water's surface and lead the recovery with the elbow. This drill ensures a relaxed, high-elbow recovery.

**Timing and Coordination Drills:**
- 6-Kick Switch: Perform six kicks on one side with the lower arm extended and the upper arm resting on the body. After six kicks, take a stroke and switch sides, focusing on maintaining a continuous stroke cycle and rhythm.
- Sculling: Using a pull buoy or kickboard between the legs, perform small sculling motions with the hands to maintain a steady forward movement. This drill helps swimmers develop a sense of timing and feel for the water.
