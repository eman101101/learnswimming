# Sidestroke

The sidestroke is a classic, energy-efficient swim stroke and can be a valuable survival skill, as the sidestroke allows you to conserve energy when doing it. Unlike other strokes that requires swimmers to rotate their body or lift their head out of the water, the sidestroke allows for a more relaxed and comfortable position. 

Before learning sidestroke, make sure to familiarize yourself with the Scissorkick, an essential component of this stroke. You can find a detailed guide on it [here](../../../guide/basicskills/scissorkick.mdx).

## Arm Movements

The arm movement in sidestroke consists of three main parts: the push, the pull, and the recovery.

**Push:**

- With your lower arm extended in front of you and your palm down, push the water towards your feet.

**Pull:**

- While your lower arm is pushing, bend your top elbow and bring your hand towards your chest.
- Then, with your palm facing down, stretch your arm out in front of you, catching the water.
- Push the water towards your feet, just as you did with your lower arm.

**Recovery:**

- After the push, bring both arms back to their starting positions. Your lower arm should be extended in front of you, and your top arm should be lying along your body.


## Practicing Sidestroke

**Body position:** Start by practicing your body position in the water. The side stroke requires you to lie on your side, with one arm extended above your head and the other arm resting along your side. Keep your body aligned and straight to minimize drag.

**Scissor kick:** Begin by performing the scissor kick while maintaining your side position. The scissor kick involves extending one leg forward and the other leg backward, with a scissoring motion. Practice this kick while focusing on maintaining a steady and smooth motion.

**Arm movements:** Once you feel comfortable with the scissor kick, add the arm movements to the equation. As you perform the scissor kick, practice the arm movements for the side stroke. Start with your arms in the initial position, with one arm extended above your head and the other resting along your side. Coordinate the arm movements with the scissor kick, ensuring a smooth and fluid motion.

**Synchronization:**
Synchronization between your legs and arms is important. Start your scissor kick at the same time you start your push with your leading (bottom) arm. Finish the kick as you finish the push with your trailing (top) arm. Your arms and legs should be extended at the same time.

## Common Mistakes in Sidestroke

1. **Mistake:** Failing to roll the body during the kick, resulting in a weak kick.
   - **Drill:** Roll and Kick Drill
      - Begin in a side position with your arms extended above your head.
      - Engage your core muscles and roll your body slightly so that your chest faces the bottom of the pool.
      - Perform the scissor kick, focusing on generating power and propulsion.
      - Practice this drill to improve the strength and effectiveness of your kick.

2. **Mistake:** Choppiness or lack of rhythm in the stroke.
   - **Drill:** Rhythmic Side Stroke Drill
      - Start in a side position with your arms extended above your head and legs extended.
      - Begin the scissor kick while simultaneously performing the side stroke arm movements.
      - Focus on maintaining a smooth and fluid motion, ensuring that your arms and legs work together in a coordinated manner.
      - Emphasize the rhythm of the stroke, making it relaxed and efficient.

3. **Mistake:** Poor body position, causing excessive drag.
   - **Drill:** Horizontal Body Position Drill
      - Swim a few lengths of the pool, focusing on keeping your body as horizontal as possible.
      - Engage your core muscles and imagine a straight line from your head to your toes.
      - Avoid allowing your legs or hips to sink, as this can create drag and slow you down.
      - Practice maintaining a streamlined body position to improve your efficiency in the water.

4. **Mistake:** Difficulty in switching sides smoothly.
   - **Drill:** Side Switch Drill
      - Start by swimming in the side stroke on one side for a set distance.
      - When you're ready to switch sides, roll over onto your other side, keeping your body position aligned.
      - As you switch sides, coordinate the arm and leg movements accordingly, ensuring a seamless transition.
      - Practice this drill to develop the ability to switch sides smoothly and maintain a continuous stroke rhythm.

5. **Mistake:** Inadequate breathing technique while on your side.
   - **Drill:** Side Breathing Drill
      - Float on your side in the water, with one arm extended above your head and the other resting along your side.
      - Turn your head to the side and exhale underwater before inhaling.
      - Practice the timing and coordination of the breath, ensuring a smooth and efficient breathing pattern.
      - Repeat this drill, focusing on maintaining a relaxed and controlled breathing technique while in the side stroke position.
