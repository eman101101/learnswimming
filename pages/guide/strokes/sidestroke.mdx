# Sidestroke

The sidestroke is a classic, energy-efficient swim stroke often used by lifeguards for rescue missions because it allows for visibility and breathing without turning the head.

## Arm Movements

There are three main parts of the arm movement: the push, the pull, and the recovery.

**Push:**

- With your lower arm extended in front of you and your palm down, push the water towards your feet.

**Pull:**

- While your lower arm is pushing, bend your top elbow and bring your hand towards your chest.
- Then, with your palm facing down, stretch your arm out in front of you, catching the water.
- Push the water towards your feet, just as you did with your lower arm.

**Recovery:**

- After the push, bring both arms back to their starting positions. Your lower arm should be extended in front of you, and your top arm should be lying along your body.

**Breathing:**

Breathe as needed. Because your head is always out of the water, you can breathe naturally. However, it is recommended to exhale underwater and inhale when your face is out of the water.

**Synchronization:**

Synchronization between your legs and arms is important. Start your scissor kick at the same time you start your push with your leading (bottom) arm. Finish the kick as you finish the push with your trailing (top) arm. Your arms and legs should be extended at the same time.

## Sidestroke Tips

- While performing the sidestroke, you should roll your body slightly so that your chest faces the bottom of the pool during the kick. This will make your kick stronger.
- Keep your movements smooth and rhythmic. Sidestroke is a relaxed, efficient stroke.
- Try to keep your body as horizontal as possible to reduce drag.
- To change sides, just roll over onto your other side and swap the roles of your arms and legs.
