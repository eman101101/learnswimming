**Breathing Drills:**
- Side Glide: Push off the wall in a horizontal position on one side, with the lower arm extended and the upper arm resting on the body. Keep the face in the water and practice turning the head to breathe while maintaining a streamlined position.
- 3/5/7 Strokes Breathing: Alternate taking breaths every 3, 5, and 7 strokes to practice bilateral breathing and improve breath control.

**Body Position Drills:**
- Superman Glide: Push off the wall in a streamlined position with arms extended in front, focusing on maintaining a horizontal body position. Glide as far as possible while engaging the core and keeping the head in a neutral position.
- Kick on Side: With fins on, kick on one side while keeping the lower arm extended and the upper arm resting on the body. Focus on maintaining a horizontal body position and engaging the core. Switch sides after each lap.

**Kicking Drills:**
- Vertical Kicking: In the deep end, perform a flutter kick while keeping the body vertical and arms crossed on the chest. Maintain a consistent rhythm and kick from the hips.
- Flutter Kick with Board: Hold a kickboard in front of the body with arms extended, focusing on a steady, controlled flutter kick. Keep the legs close together and kick from the hips.

**Arm Pull Drills:**
- Single-Arm Drill: Swim the front crawl using only one arm while keeping the other arm extended in front. Focus on the S-curve pull and high-elbow catch. Use a pull buoy or kickboard to help with balance. Switch arms after each lap.
- Catch-Up Drill: Start with both arms extended in front. Begin the pull with one arm and only start the pull with the other arm once the first arm has returned to the front. This drill emphasizes the catch and pull phases of the stroke.

**Recovery Drills:**
- Zipper Drill: During the recovery phase, imagine zipping up a jacket by dragging the thumb along the side of the body and keeping the elbow high. This promotes a high-elbow recovery and reduces drag.
- Fingertip Drag: During the recovery phase, keep the fingertips close to the water's surface and lead the recovery with the elbow. This drill ensures a relaxed, high-elbow recovery.

**Timing and Coordination Drills:**
- 6-Kick Switch: Perform six kicks on one side with the lower arm extended and the upper arm resting on the body. After six kicks, take a stroke and switch sides, focusing on maintaining a continuous stroke cycle and rhythm.
- Sculling: Using a pull buoy or kickboard between the legs, perform small sculling motions with the hands to maintain a steady forward movement. This drill helps swimmers develop a sense of timing and feel for the water.

## Common Mistakes and Tips

1. **Over-rotating**: Maintain a stable body position by keeping your body flat on its side, avoiding excessive rotation.
2. **Inefficient kicks**: Focus on keeping your legs straight and toes pointed during the scissor kick, maximizing propulsion.
3. **Sinking**: Maintain a horizontal body position by keeping your core engaged and hips slightly elevated.
4. **Rushed arm movement**: Move your arms in a slow, sweeping motion, allowing for a stronger pull and increased efficiency.

## Practice Drills

1. **One-arm Sidestroke**: Swim sidestroke using only your leading arm, keeping your trailing arm at your side. This drill helps improve your leading arm's pulling strength.
2. **Sidestroke Kick with Fins**: Using swim fins, practice the sidestroke kick while holding a kickboard or with your arms extended. This drill improves your kick's propulsion and strength.
3. **Sidestroke Glide**: After each complete arm pull and scissor kick, glide for a few seconds before resuming the stroke. This drill emphasizes the importance of a strong glide and proper body position.
