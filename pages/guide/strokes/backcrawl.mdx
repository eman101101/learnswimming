# Backcrawl

## Learning Back Crawl

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform the backcrawl swimming technique:

1. Body position
- Lie flat on your back in the water, with your head slightly tilted back.
- Keep your body as straight as possible, with your legs close together.
- Your hips should be close to the surface, and your shoulders should roll slightly from side to side as you move.

2. Arm movement
- Start with one arm by your side and the other extended above your head.
- Raise the arm by your side, bending at the elbow, until your fingertips point to the ceiling.
- Sweep your arm overhead, keeping your elbow slightly bent and your hand facing outwards.
- Extend your arm fully as it moves above your head, entering the water with your little finger first.
- Pull your arm through the water, applying pressure downwards and backwards until it reaches your thigh.
- Alternate arm movements, ensuring one arm is always extended as the other is pulling.

3. Leg movement
- Perform a flutter kick, which involves alternating up-and-down movements with your legs.
- Keep your legs straight and close together, using your hips to generate the movement.
- Point your toes and kick from the surface to avoid creating drag.
- Maintain a steady, rhythmic kick throughout the backcrawl.

4. Breathing
- Since your face is out of the water, breathing is easier in backstroke.
- Breathe in through your mouth as your arm comes out of the water, and exhale through your nose or mouth as your arm goes back in.
- Maintain a steady breathing rhythm to avoid hyperventilation or breathlessness.

5. Timing
- Coordinate your arm and leg movements to maximize propulsion and minimize drag.
- As one arm reaches the halfway point in the pulling phase, the other should be entering the water.
- Match your flutter kicks to your arm movements, ensuring they are in sync.

## Improving Back Crawl

Introduction:
The back crawl, also known as the backstroke, is a popular swimming technique that provides a full-body workout while allowing the swimmer to breathe easily. However, like any other swimming technique, mastering the back crawl can be challenging for some. In this guide, we will discuss the common struggles associated with the back crawl and offer practical solutions to help you overcome these issues and swim more efficiently.

1. Head Position:
Struggle: Swimmers often struggle with maintaining a neutral head position, which can lead to excessive strain on the neck and inefficient swimming.
Solution: Keep your head in line with your spine and look straight up at the sky or ceiling. This will help maintain a neutral head position, reducing neck strain and improving your overall body alignment.

2. Body Rotation:
Struggle: Insufficient body rotation can result in limited arm reach and inefficient propulsion through the water.
Solution: Focus on rotating your shoulders and hips as you swim. This will help you achieve a greater range of motion, allowing for a more powerful and efficient arm pull.

3. Arm Movement:
Struggle: Swimmers often bend their arms too much during the recovery phase, which can lead to a shorter stroke and reduced efficiency.
Solution: Keep your arms straight and close to the surface of the water during the recovery phase. This will help maximize your stroke length and improve your overall efficiency.

4. Hand Entry and Exit:
Struggle: Incorrect hand entry and exit can cause increased drag and reduced propulsion.
Solution: Enter the water with your pinky finger first, at an angle of about 45 degrees, and exit with your thumb brushing your thigh. This will help minimize drag and maximize propulsion through the water.

5. Leg Kick:
Struggle: Swimmers may have an inefficient or uncoordinated leg kick, which can result in poor propulsion and body position.
Solution: Focus on maintaining a consistent, fluid kicking motion with your legs, keeping them fairly straight and close together. Practice kicking on your back while holding a kickboard to help develop proper technique.

6. Timing and Coordination:
Struggle: Swimmers may struggle to synchronize their arm and leg movements, resulting in an inefficient and tiring stroke.
Solution: Practice the catch-up drill, where one arm remains extended above your head while the other completes a full stroke. This helps to improve your timing and coordination, leading to a smoother and more efficient back crawl.

7. Breathing:
Struggle: Swimmers may hold their breath or have an irregular breathing pattern, leading to fatigue and poor performance.
Solution: Focus on maintaining a consistent and relaxed breathing pattern, exhaling as your arm enters the water and inhaling as it exits. This will help you to maintain a steady oxygen supply and swim more efficiently.

## Back Crawl Drills

Introduction:
Incorporating drills into your swimming routine can help you focus on specific aspects of the back crawl technique and address common struggles. Below, we provide drills for each of the problems mentioned earlier, allowing you to refine your skills and swim more efficiently.

1. Head Position Drill - Water Bottle Balance:
Objective: Improve neutral head position and body alignment.
Drill: Place a water bottle or similar object on your forehead while swimming the back crawl. The goal is to keep the bottle balanced and prevent it from falling. This encourages you to maintain a neutral head position and proper body alignment.

2. Body Rotation Drill - Side Kick:
Objective: Enhance body rotation and hip stability.
Drill: Kick on  side with one arm extended above your head and the other resting along your body. Rotate your body from side to side while maintaining a steady kick. This helps develop body rotation and hip stability, which are crucial for efficient back crawl swimming.
your
3. Arm Movement Drill - Single-Arm Backstroke:
Objective: Improve arm extension and recovery phase.
Drill: Swim the back crawl using only one arm, keeping the other arm resting on your side. Focus on maintaining a straight arm during the recovery phase and fully extending it upon entry into the water. Switch arms after completing a set distance or number of strokes.

4. Hand Entry and Exit Drill - Catch-up Backstroke:
Objective: Refine hand entry and exit techniques.
Drill: Begin with both arms extended above your head. Pull with one arm while the other remains extended. Once the pulling arm completes the stroke and returns to the starting position, initiate the pull with the opposite arm. This drill emphasizes proper hand entry and exit, improving propulsion and reducing drag.

5. Leg Kick Drill - Backstroke Kick with Kickboard:
Objective: Develop a strong, consistent kick.
Drill: Hold a kickboard above your head or at your chest while lying on your back. Focus on maintaining a consistent and fluid kicking motion, keeping your legs relatively straight and close together. This drill helps build leg strength and refine your backstroke kicking technique.

6. Timing and Coordination Drill - Alternating Arm Backstroke:
Objective: Improve the synchronization of arm and leg movements.
Drill: Swim back crawl, but pause briefly at the end of each arm stroke. This forces you to focus on coordinating your arm and leg movements, leading to better timing and a smoother, more efficient stroke.

7. Breathing Drill - 3-3-3 Backstroke:
Objective: Establish a consistent and relaxed breathing pattern.
Drill: Swim back crawl, taking three strokes while exhaling, followed by three strokes while inhaling. This encourages a consistent and relaxed breathing pattern, helping you maintain a steady oxygen supply for more efficient swimming.

Conclusion:
Incorporating these drills into your swimming routine will help you target specific areas of your back crawl technique and address common struggles. Practice these drills consistently to develop your skills, improve your technique, and become a stronger, more efficient backstroke swimmer.
