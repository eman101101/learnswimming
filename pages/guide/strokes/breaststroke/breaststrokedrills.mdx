Breathe in quickly and smoothly through your mouth, then lower your head back into the water as your hands start the push phase.
Timing and Rhythm Drill:

Swim breaststroke while emphasizing a strong glide after each arm pull and leg kick.
Count your strokes and kicks to develop a sense of rhythm and coordination.
Practice maintaining a steady and consistent timing between the arm pull, kick, and breathing.
