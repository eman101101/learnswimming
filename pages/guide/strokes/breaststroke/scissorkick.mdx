# Scissor Kick
1. Begin by lying on your back in the water, with your arms extended along your sides and your legs straight out. Ensure that your head is in a neutral position and your body is aligned.

2. Gently bend your knees and bring your heels up toward your buttocks, keeping your feet relaxed and your toes pointed.

3. In one swift motion, separate your legs so that they are shoulder-width apart, while simultaneously pointing your toes outward. This movement will create a "V" shape with your legs.

4. Cross your ankles, with one leg slightly above the other, and bring your heels back up toward your buttocks to return your legs to the starting position.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, alternating the position of your legs each time so that one leg is on top of the other. This should create a continuous, rhythmic scissor-like movement.

6. Focus on keeping your legs straight and close together during each cycle to minimize drag and increase your efficiency in the water.

7. Engage your core muscles to power the kick, rather than relying solely on your leg strength. This will help to maintain proper body alignment and ensure that your entire body is working together to propel you forward.

8. Remember to breathe in a relaxed and controlled manner, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth as you kick.

Once you are comfortable with the scissor kick, you can increase the speed and intensity of the movement to improve your overall swimming performance.
