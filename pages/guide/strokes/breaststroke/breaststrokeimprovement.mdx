Breaststroke is a graceful yet efficient swimming stroke that requires precise timing, body positioning, and coordination. By understanding and rectifying these common errors, you'll be well on your way to improving your breaststroke technique and becoming a more proficient swimmer. Let's dive in!

Mistake: Incorrect Body Position

Many swimmers tend to swim with their hips too low, causing their legs to drag and creating unnecessary resistance.
Another common mistake is keeping the head too high, which leads to a misalignment of the body and inefficient propulsion.
Fix:

To correct the body position, focus on keeping your hips higher in the water. Imagine your body forming a straight line from your head to your hips, with your legs floating near the surface.
Keep your head in a neutral position, aligned with your body. Look forward and slightly downward to maintain proper body alignment.
Mistake: Scissor Kick

A common mistake swimmers make in breaststroke is using a scissor kick instead of a proper whip kick.
Scissoring the legs creates excessive drag, slows down forward momentum, and leads to inefficient propulsion.
Fix:

Master the whip kick technique. Start by bringing your heels towards your glutes, keeping your knees close together.
Initiate the kick by quickly extending your legs backward and outward in a circular motion, similar to a frog kick. Finish the kick by bringing your feet together.
Focus on generating power from your hips and core muscles rather than relying solely on your legs.
Mistake: Overreaching Arm Pull

Many swimmers tend to overreach their arm pull, which causes excessive resistance and slows down the stroke rhythm.
Overreaching can also strain the shoulder joint and lead to inefficient propulsion.
Fix:

Maintain a relaxed and natural arm extension. Instead of overreaching, focus on bringing your hands forward in a slightly wider path, forming a diamond shape.
Initiate the arm pull by bending your elbows and bringing your hands towards your chest.
As your hands reach your chest, push them out and away from your body in a powerful and circular motion, propelling yourself forward.
Mistake: Improper Breathing Technique

In breaststroke, incorrect breathing technique often results in disrupted rhythm and unnecessary energy expenditure.
Some swimmers lift their heads too high, causing the hips to drop and creating additional resistance.
Fix:

Time your breath with your arm recovery. As your arms begin to extend forward after the pull, lift your head slightly above the water.
Breathe in quickly through your mouth, aiming to keep the movement smooth and uninterrupted.
Lower your head back into the water as your hands start their powerful push phase.
Mistake: Insufficient Glide and Timing

Many swimmers rush through the breaststroke, failing to take advantage of the gliding phase and compromising overall efficiency.
Poor timing between the pull, kick, and breathing can disrupt the stroke rhythm.
Fix:

Emphasize a strong glide after each arm pull and leg kick. Stretch your body forward, keeping it streamlined, and allow yourself to glide for a brief moment.
Work on timing the arm pull, kick, and breathing to create a smooth and continuous motion. Practice the stroke rhythm and coordination through repetition and drills.
