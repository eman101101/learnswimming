# Breast Stroke
1.  Body Position: Start by floating on your stomach in the water, with your arms extended in front of you and your legs extended behind you. Your head should be facing down.
    
2.  Pull: To begin the stroke, pull your arms back towards your chest, keeping your elbows tucked in close to your body. As your hands reach your chest, push them forward and out in front of you.
    
3.  Kick: At the same time, bring your legs up towards your body, bending your knees and bringing your heels towards your buttocks. Then, extend your legs out and back, pushing against the water with the soles of your feet.
    
4.  Glide: As you finish the pull and kick, bring your arms and legs back into the starting position and glide forward for a moment before starting the stroke again.
    
5.  Timing: The key to a successful breaststroke is the timing of the pull and kick. As your arms begin to pull back, your legs should be starting to come up towards your body. As your arms push forward, your legs should be extending out and back.
    
6.  Breathing: As with other swimming strokes, it's important to coordinate your breathing with your stroke. Take a breath as your arms push forward, and exhale as your face enters the water during the pull.
    
7.  Practice: The breaststroke can take some time and practice to master. Start slowly and focus on getting the timing and coordination right. Use a kickboard or pull buoy to isolate the arms or legs for extra practice.
    

Remember to keep a steady and relaxed pace, and to maintain good body position and form throughout the stroke. With practice, you'll be able to swim the breaststroke with ease and efficiency.
