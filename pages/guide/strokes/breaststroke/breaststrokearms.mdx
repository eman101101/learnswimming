# Breaststroke Arm Technique

The breaststroke arm technique is an essential part of the breaststroke swimming style. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform it:

## 1. Initial Position
- Begin in a streamlined position with your body flat and your arms extended straight in front of you, shoulder-width apart.
- Your palms should be facing down, and your fingers should be close together.

## 2. Outward Sweep
- Start the arm movement by bending your elbows and sweeping your hands outwards in a semicircular motion.
- Keep your fingers together and palms facing outwards.
- At the end of the sweep, your arms should form a 'Y' shape with your body, with elbows slightly bent and hands wider than your shoulders.

## 3. Inward Sweep
- Once your hands reach the widest point of the outward sweep, rotate your palms inward to face your body.
- Begin the inward sweep by bringing your hands back towards each other, maintaining a slight bend in your elbows.
- Your hands should stay below the surface of the water and below your chest throughout the inward sweep.

## 4. Recovery Phase
- At the end of the inward sweep, your hands should come together just below your chest.
- Quickly shoot your hands forward, extending your arms back to the initial streamlined position.
- Keep your hands close to the surface of the water during the recovery phase to minimize drag.

## 5. Timing
- The arm movements should be synchronized with the whip kick in the breaststroke.
- As your arms are extending forward in the glide phase, your legs should perform the whip kick.
- Glide for a moment with your arms extended and your legs together before starting the next arm stroke and kick.

## 6. Breathing
- Inhale during the inward sweep as your head naturally rises above the water.
- Exhale during the recovery phase and the beginning of the next outward sweep, as your head goes back underwater.

## 7. Practice
- Work on the arm technique separately by using a pull buoy to isolate your upper body.
- Focus on maintaining a smooth, continuous arm movement and coordinating it with your breathing.
- As you become more comfortable with the arm technique, start incorporating the whip kick to practice the full breaststroke.

By practicing the breaststroke arm technique regularly, you'll improve your efficiency and speed in the water. Remember, patience and consistency are key to mastering this swimming style.
