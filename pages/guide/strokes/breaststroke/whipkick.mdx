# Whip Kick Swimming Technique

The whip kick, also known as the breaststroke kick, is a common swimming technique used in the breaststroke. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform it:

## 1. Initial Position
- Start in a streamlined position with your body flat and your legs extended straight behind you.
- Keep your feet together and your toes pointed.

## 2. Bend the Knees
- Start the kick by bending your knees and bringing your heels towards your buttocks.
- Keep your thighs in the same position and your knees not too far apart, roughly hip-width.

## 3. Turn Out the Feet
- Once your heels are close to your buttocks, start turning your feet outward, preparing for the propulsive phase of the kick.

## 4. Propulsive Phase
- Extend your legs sideways and backwards in a circular, whip-like motion.
- Your feet should be flexed during this phase, with the soles of your feet pushing against the water for maximum propulsion.
- The legs come back together with your feet pointed, and you return to the initial streamlined position.

## 5. Timing
- The whip kick is typically synchronized with the arm strokes in the breaststroke.
- As your arms extend forward in the glide phase, your legs should be performing the whip kick.

## 6. Practice
- Practice the whip kick separately by using a kickboard or holding onto the pool's edge.
- Initially, you may find it helpful to exaggerate the circular motion of the kick until you get the feel for it.
- As you become more proficient, the movement will become more efficient and less wide.

## Note
The whip kick requires a good deal of flexibility in the hips and ankles. If you're finding the whip kick challenging, you may need to work on improving your flexibility. Also, remember that it's a technique that requires a bit of practice to master, so be patient with yourself and keep practicing.
