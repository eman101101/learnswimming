## Practicing Breaststroke
Body position: Start by floating in a horizontal position with your face down in the water, arms extended in front of you, and legs straight behind you. Your body should be streamlined.

Arm pull: Begin the arm pull by bending your elbows and moving your hands outward in a circular motion. Keep your fingers together and your hands flat. As your hands move apart, maintain a 90-degree angle at the elbow joint. The pull should be powerful but not too wide. The wider the pull, the more resistance you create.

Recovery and glide: As your hands reach the widest point of the arm pull, start bringing them back towards the center of your body, close to your chest. Your elbows should be close to your ribcage. Once your hands are close to your chest, extend your arms straight out in front of you, returning to the starting position. Glide for a moment in this streamlined position.

Whip kick: As your arms are recovering and extending forward, begin the whip kick. Bend your knees and bring your heels towards your buttocks. Rotate your feet outwards, and then kick with both legs in a circular motion, like a frog kick. Make sure to keep your feet flexed throughout the kick.

Timing: Timing is crucial in breaststroke. As you extend your arms forward into the glide, your legs should be finishing the kick. This coordinated movement will help you maintain a streamlined position and move more efficiently through the water.

Breathing: During the arm pull phase, lift your head slightly out of the water to take a quick breath. Exhale as you extend your arms forward and return your face to the water. Make sure your head follows the natural body movement to avoid straining your neck.
