# Dolphin Kick: A Complete Guide

Dolphin kick is a swimming technique often used in the butterfly stroke and in the underwater portions of turns in freestyle and backstroke. This guide is designed to help you master this swimming technique.

## Step 1: Understanding Dolphin Kick

Before you start practicing the dolphin kick, it's important to understand the mechanics behind it.

**How it works:**

- Dolphin kick requires full-body movement. Your body should move in a wave-like motion, originating from your chest and flowing through to your feet.
- Your legs should stay together as if they are one, hence the name "dolphin kick".

## Step 2: Dryland Training

Start by practicing the dolphin kick motion on dry land. This will help you get a feel for the movement.

**Exercise:**

1. Lie down on your stomach.
2. Lift your chest and legs off the ground, keeping your legs together.
3. Create a wave-like motion, starting from your chest and flowing through to your feet.

## Step 3: Pool Practice

Now it's time to take the dolphin kick into the water.

**Exercise:**

1. Hold onto the side of the pool.
2. Practice the dolphin kick motion in the water, making sure your legs are together.
3. Try to create a wave-like motion, starting from your chest and flowing through to your feet.

## Step 4: Integrating with Strokes

Once you're comfortable with the dolphin kick, try integrating it into your strokes.

**Exercise:**

1. Start with the butterfly stroke. Remember to kick twice per stroke â€“ once at the start and once at the end.
2. Practice dolphin kicking off the wall after a turn in freestyle or backstroke. Remember, you're allowed to kick up to 15 meters underwater.

## Step 5: Refining Your Technique

The final step is to refine your technique.

**Tips:**

- Keep your knees slightly bent, but not too much.
- Keep your ankles loose for better propulsion.
- Focus on your core. Your power comes from there.
- Use fins to help improve your dolphin kick.
