# Common Butterfly Mistakes and How to Fix Them

The butterfly stroke is a challenging technique to master. This guide will highlight common mistakes in the butterfly stroke and provide solutions to help you correct them.

## Mistake 1: Lifting the Head Too High

**Problem:** Lifting your head too high during the breathing phase can cause your hips to drop, creating more drag and reducing your efficiency.

**Solution:** Keep your chin close to the water's surface when taking a breath. Focus on breathing forward rather than upward.

## Mistake 2: Inefficient Arm Recovery

**Problem:** Bending your arms too much or keeping them too wide during the recovery phase can lead to reduced efficiency and increased fatigue.

**Solution:** Keep your arms straight and close to the water's surface during the recovery phase. Move them in a controlled, circular motion.

## Mistake 3: Insufficient Dolphin Kick

**Problem:** A weak or inconsistent dolphin kick can result in a less efficient butterfly stroke.

**Solution:** Focus on developing a strong, consistent dolphin kick. Remember to initiate the kick from your core and hips, maintaining a fluid motion through your legs.
