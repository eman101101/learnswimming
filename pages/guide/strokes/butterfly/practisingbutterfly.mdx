# Butterfly Stroke: Combining Dolphin Kick and Butterfly Arms

After mastering the dolphin kick and butterfly arms, it's time to combine them and perform the complete butterfly stroke. This guide will walk you through the process of integrating both movements to create a fluid, powerful, and efficient butterfly stroke.

## Step 1: Understanding the Butterfly Stroke

To execute the butterfly stroke effectively, it's crucial to understand how the dolphin kick and butterfly arms work together.

**How it works:**

- The butterfly stroke consists of two main components: the dolphin kick and the butterfly arms.
- The arms and legs should move in a synchronized manner, creating a smooth and continuous motion.

## Step 2: Coordination Practice

Begin by practicing the coordination of your dolphin kick and butterfly arms on dry land.

**Exercise:**

1. Lie down on your stomach.
2. Perform the dolphin kick motion while simultaneously practicing the butterfly arms movement.
3. Focus on coordinating the movements of your arms and legs, creating a fluid motion.

## Step 3: Pool Practice

Now it's time to take your combined movements into the water.

**Exercise:**

1. Start by floating on your stomach with your arms extended in front of you.
2. Perform the butterfly arms motion, pulling your arms through the water and lifting them out during the recovery phase.
3. As you pull your arms through the water, perform a dolphin kick.
4. As you lift your arms out of the water, perform another dolphin kick.
5. Continue this sequence, focusing on coordinating your arm and leg movements.

## Step 4: Breathing Technique

Incorporating proper breathing technique is essential for an efficient butterfly stroke.

**Exercise:**

1. As your arms begin the recovery phase, lift your head to take a breath.
2. Keep your head in a neutral position, looking down at the bottom of the pool, when not breathing.
3. Exhale underwater as your arms move through the pull phase.

## Step 5: Refining Your Technique

The final step is to refine your butterfly stroke technique.

**Tips:**

- Maintain a steady rhythm, with the timing of your breaths and strokes.
- Keep your body as close to the surface of the water as possible.
- Use your core muscles to generate power and drive the undulating motion.
- Focus on maintaining a streamlined body position, reducing drag.
