## Sidestroke Technique Breakdown

### Body Position

1. Lie on your side with your head aligned with your spine, looking forward.
2. Keep the lower arm extended in front of your body and the upper arm resting along your side.

### Arm Movement

1. The leading arm (lower arm) pulls water towards your chest in a sweeping motion.
2. As the leading arm completes its pull, bend the trailing arm (upper arm) at the elbow, and sweep it forward in an arc towards the leading arm.
3. When the trailing arm reaches the leading arm, extend both arms forward and repeat the process.

### Leg Movement (Scissor Kick)

1. Start with your legs slightly bent and together.
2. Kick your top leg forward and your bottom leg backward, opening them in a scissor-like motion.
3. Snap your legs back together, using the force of the movement to propel you forward.

### Breathing

1. Keep your face out of the water while swimming sidestroke, inhaling through your mouth and exhaling through your nose.
