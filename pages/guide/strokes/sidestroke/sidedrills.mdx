## Practice Drills

1. **One-arm Sidestroke**: Swim sidestroke using only your leading arm, keeping your trailing arm at your side. This drill helps improve your leading arm's pulling strength.
2. **Sidestroke Kick with Fins**: Using swim fins, practice the sidestroke kick while holding a kickboard or with your arms extended. This drill improves your kick's propulsion and strength.
3. **Sidestroke Glide**: After each complete arm pull and scissor kick, glide for a few seconds before resuming the stroke. This drill emphasizes the importance of a strong glide and proper body position.
