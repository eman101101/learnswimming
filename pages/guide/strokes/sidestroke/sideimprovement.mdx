## Common Mistakes and Tips

1. **Over-rotating**: Maintain a stable body position by keeping your body flat on its side, avoiding excessive rotation.
2. **Inefficient kicks**: Focus on keeping your legs straight and toes pointed during the scissor kick, maximizing propulsion.
3. **Sinking**: Maintain a horizontal body position by keeping your core engaged and hips slightly elevated.
4. **Rushed arm movement**: Move your arms in a slow, sweeping motion, allowing for a stronger pull and increased efficiency.
