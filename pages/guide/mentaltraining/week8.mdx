The second part of this module addresses how to stay calm under pressure. Participants will learn techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and positive self-talk to manage race day nerves.

By incorporating these strategies, swimmers can maintain their composure and focus, enabling them to perform at their best under pressure. By the end of this module, participants will have a toolkit of techniques to help them stay focused and calm on race day.

**Module 3: Post-Race Reflection and Learning**

The third module of Week 8 introduces the concept of post-race reflection and learning. This module aims to help participants understand that learning and improvement continue even after the race ends.

The module starts by discussing the significance of reflection in the learning process. Participants will understand how reflecting on their performance can provide valuable insights, helping identify strengths to build upon and areas for improvement.

The second half of this module guides participants in developing their own post-race reflection routine. This includes considering questions such as: What went well? What didn't go as planned? What can I learn from this? How can I apply these lessons in the future?

Participants will also be encouraged to reflect on their mental state during the race, examining their focus, self-talk, and emotional control. By the end of this module, swimmers will have a personal reflection routine to facilitate continuous learning and performance enhancement.

The final module of The Mindful Swimmer course helps participants consolidate their learning and create their own Mental Strength Blueprint. This blueprint will serve as a personal guide for mental skills training, incorporating key concepts and techniques from the course.

The module begins by guiding participants in reviewing and reflecting on their journey through the course, encouraging them to identify key learnings and insights.

In the second part of this module, participants will create their Mental Strength Blueprint. This will include their personal goals, their pre-race and post-race routines, their techniques for stress management, focus, and visualization, and their strategies for building resilience.

By the end of this module, and the course, participants will have a personalized, comprehensive mental training plan, empowering them to continue developing their mental skills and achieving their swimming goals with confidence, focus, and resilience.

**Post-Course Follow-Up**

Approximately one month after the conclusion of the course, we will conduct a post-course follow-up. This will include:

A follow-up questionnaire to assess participants' progress since completing the course.
An online Q&A session to answer any questions participants may have and address any challenges they are facing in applying the course content.
Providing additional resources based on common areas of difficulty identified during the follow-up session.
Encouraging participants to share their experiences, progress, and tips with each other to facilitate peer learning.
Setting goals for future mental skills development and encouraging ongoing practice of the techniques learned in the course.
This follow-up session will ensure participants receive ongoing support in their journey of mental skills development and will help to consolidate and reinforce the skills and knowledge gained during the course.
