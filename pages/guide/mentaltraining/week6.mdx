**Week 6: Stress Management and Recovery**

**Module 1: Understanding Stress and Its Impact on Performance**

Page 1:
The first module of Week 6 delves into the concept of stress and its impact on performance. The module begins by defining stress and differentiating between eustress (positive stress that can motivate and improve performance) and distress (negative stress that can harm health and hinder performance).

Participants will learn about the physiological and psychological responses to stress, such as increased heart rate, heightened alertness, anxiety, and decreased focus. The module will also cover the concept of the "stress-performance curve," illustrating how performance can increase with moderate stress but decrease with high stress levels.

The second part of the module focuses on the specific impact of stress on swimming performance. Participants will discuss how stress can affect concentration, decision-making, and physical control â€“ all critical aspects of a swimmer's performance. The module will also cover the cumulative effect of chronic stress, highlighting the importance of stress management not only for optimal performance but also for overall well-being.

By the end of this module, participants will have a clear understanding of stress, its potential impacts on their performance, and the importance of effective stress management.
