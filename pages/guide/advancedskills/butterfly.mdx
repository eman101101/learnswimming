# Butterfly

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
WARNING! Butterfly requires significant upper body and core strength, as well as flexibility and coordination. It involves powerful movements that put strain on various muscle groups, joints, and tendons. The most common injury is with the shoulder. The arm movements can increase the risk of shoulder injuries, including dislocations. If you have a history of shoulder injuries do not try to learn the butterfly stroke without talking to a doctor.

## Butterfly Arms

### Understanding Butterfly Arms

Before practicing the butterfly arms, grasp their mechanics:

- Butterfly arms move symmetrically in a circular motion.
- Keep your arms straight during the recovery phase and slightly bent during the pull phase.

### Dryland Training

Practice the butterfly arms motion on dry land:

1. Stand upright with arms extended in front of you.
2. Move your arms outward in a circular motion, keeping them straight.
3. Bend your elbows slightly as you bring your arms back toward your chest.
4. Straighten your arms to return to the starting position.

### Pool Practice

Take the butterfly arms technique into the water:

1. Hold onto the pool's side and practice the butterfly arms motion.
2. Keep your arms straight during the recovery phase and slightly bent during the pull phase.
3. Focus on pulling water toward your chest and pushing it back behind you.

### Refining Your Technique

Refine your butterfly arms technique using these tips:

- Keep your head in a neutral position, looking down at the pool's bottom.
- Breathe during the recovery phase when your arms are out of the water.
- Maintain a close-to-surface body position and minimize drag.
- Utilize paddles to improve arm strength and technique.

## Complete Butterfly Stroke

### Coordination Practice

Practice coordinating the dolphin kick and butterfly arms on dry land:

1. Lie on your stomach and perform the dolphin kick while

 simultaneously practicing the butterfly arms movement.
2. Focus on creating a fluid motion by coordinating your arms and legs.

### Pool Practice

Take the combined movements into the water:

1. Float on your stomach with arms extended in front.
2. Perform the butterfly arms motion while incorporating the dolphin kick.
3. Coordinate your arm and leg movements for a fluid stroke.

### Breathing Technique

Incorporate proper breathing technique:

1. Lift your head to take a breath as your arms begin the recovery phase.
2. Keep your head neutral and close to the water's surface when not breathing.
3. Exhale underwater as your arms move through the pull phase.

### Refining Your Technique

Refine your butterfly stroke technique with these tips:

- Maintain a steady rhythm between breaths and strokes.
- Keep your body close to the water's surface to reduce drag.
- Utilize core muscles for power and undulating motion.
- Maintain a streamlined body position.

## Common Mistakes in Butterfly

Here are some common mistakes in the butterfly stroke and their solutions:

### Lifting the Head Too High

**Problem:** Lifting the head too high during breathing can cause the hips to drop, increasing drag and reducing efficiency.

**Solution:** Keep the chin close to the water's surface when taking a breath. Focus on a forward breath rather than an upward one.

### Inefficient Arm Recovery

**Problem:** Bending the arms too much or keeping them too wide during the recovery phase can reduce efficiency and increase fatigue.

**Solution:** Keep the arms straight and close to the water's surface during recovery. Move them in a controlled, circular motion.

### Insufficient Dolphin Kick

**Problem:** A weak or inconsistent dolphin kick can hinder an efficient butterfly stroke.

**Solution:** Focus on developing a strong and consistent dolphin kick. Initiate the kick from the core and hips while maintaining a fluid leg motion.

## Butterfly Drills
Try these drills to improve your butterfly stroke technique:

### One-Arm Butterfly

**Purpose:** Isolate each arm to focus on proper arm movement and recovery.

**How to do it:**

1. Swim the butterfly stroke with one arm while keeping the other arm extended in front.
2. Switch arms after a set distance.
3. Pay attention to proper arm recovery and maintaining a straight arm during recovery.

### Body Dolphin

**Purpose:** Emphasize the dolphin kick to improve undulation and body position.

**How to do it:**

1. Start with arms at your sides or extended in front.
2. Perform the dolphin kick without using your arms.
3. Focus on initiating the kick from the core and hips while maintaining fluid leg motion.

### Head-Lead Butterfly

**Purpose:** Focus on maintaining proper head position and breathing technique.

**How to do it:**

1. Swim the butterfly stroke while keeping your head above the water.
2. Keep your chin close to the water's surface and breathe forward.
3. After a set distance, return to regular butterfly swimming, applying the same head and breathing techniques.

### Kickboard Butterfly

**Purpose:** Concentrate on coordinating the dolphin kick and arm pull.

**How to do it:**

1. Hold a kickboard with both hands in front of you.
2. Swim the butterfly stroke, using the kickboard to maintain arm position.
3. Focus on coordinating the dolphin kick with each arm pull, ensuring a fluid and consistent motion.
