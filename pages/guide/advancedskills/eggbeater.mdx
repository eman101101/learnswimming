## Eggbeater Kick

The eggbeater kick is a crucial skill in treading water, water polo, synchronized swimming, and other aquatic activities. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to help you learn and master the eggbeater kick.

### Understanding the Eggbeater Kick

The eggbeater kick is a continuous and alternating motion of the legs that provides lift and stability in the water.

**Key components of the eggbeater kick:**

- Leg movement: Legs move in a circular, alternating motion, resembling the movement of an eggbeater.
- Buoyancy: The eggbeater kick generates upward lift, allowing you to keep your head above water.
- Stability: The kick provides stability and balance while treading water or performing other aquatic activities.

### Dryland Practice

Before practicing the eggbeater kick in the water, try performing the motion on dry land to familiarize yourself with the movement.

**Dryland exercise:**

1. Sit on a bench or chair with your feet flat on the ground.
2. Lift your knees and draw your heels toward your buttocks.
3. Rotate your right leg outward, moving your right foot in a clockwise circular motion.
4. Simultaneously, rotate your left leg outward, moving your left foot in a counterclockwise circular motion.
5. Practice this motion several times to get comfortable with the movement.

### Pool Practice – Shallow Water

Begin practicing the eggbeater kick in shallow water where you can stand comfortably.

**Exercise:**

1. Stand in shallow water with your feet flat on the pool floor.
2. Bend your knees and lift your feet off the ground, allowing your body to float.
3. Perform the eggbeater kick motion you practiced on dry land, rotating your legs in alternating circular movements.
4. Focus on generating upward lift to keep your head above water.
5. Continue practicing until you feel comfortable and can maintain your position in the water.

### Pool Practice – Deep Water

Once you're comfortable with the eggbeater kick in shallow water, move to deeper water where you can't touch the bottom.

**Exercise:**

1. Start in a vertical position in deep water, with your arms at your sides or treading water.
2. Perform the eggbeater kick motion, rotating your legs in alternating circular movements.
3. Keep your head above water and maintain a steady rhythm with your leg movements.
4. Continue practicing until you can tread water using the eggbeater kick for an extended period.
