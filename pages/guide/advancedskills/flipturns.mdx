# Flip Turns

Flip turns, also known as tumble turns, are a vital swimming skill used to change direction at the end of a pool without breaking stroke or losing momentum. This technique is often used in freestyle or backstroke, and mastering it can significantly improve your swim efficiency and speed. This guide will provide a step-by-step process to learning flip turns. 

## Understanding Flip Turns 

A flip turn involves a somersault-like motion underwater, followed by a push off from the pool wall with your feet, which propels you to continue swimming in the opposite direction. It's essentially a quick and efficient way to turn around without losing speed or momentum. 

## Steps to Learning Flip Turns

### 1. Practice Somersaults in the Water

Before attempting flip turns, it's essential to get comfortable with somersaults in the water.

**Exercise:**

1. **Position:** Start in the shallow end of the pool, ideally where you can stand. Position yourself a comfortable distance away from the wall.

2. **Somersault:** With a deep breath, tuck your chin towards your chest, pull your knees towards your chest, and use your core to roll forward. 

3. **Complete the Roll:** Continue the roll until you're back to an upright position, and then stand. 

Repeat the process until you're comfortable with somersaulting in the water.

### 2. Approach the Wall

Incorporating the wall into your somersault is the next step. 

**Exercise:**

1. **Position:** Start swimming freestyle towards the wall.

2. **Approach:** As you approach the wall, about an arm's length away, start your somersault. 

3. **Somersault:** Do a forward roll, tucking in your chin and pulling your knees to your chest. The momentum from your swimming should assist with the flip.

4. **Stand:** After the roll, plant your feet on the wall and stand up.

Repeat until you're comfortable approaching the wall and performing the somersault.

### 3. Push Off the Wall 

The next step is to use the wall to push off and initiate your turn.

**Exercise:**

1. **Approach:** Similar to the previous exercise, swim towards the wall. 

2. **Somersault:** Start your somersault when you're about an arm's length away. 

3. **Position for Push:** As you roll, extend your legs and plant your feet on the wall, with your knees bent at a comfortable angle. 

4. **Push Off:** Push off from the wall, straightening your legs, and extend your body into a streamlined position. 

5. **Glide & Swim:** Glide for a moment, then resume your swimming stroke.

### 4. Adding the Twist

Now, we'll add a twist to transition into swimming.

**Exercise:**

1. **Approach:** Swim towards the wall and begin your somersault as usual.

2. **Position for Push:** Plant your feet on the wall with your knees bent.

3. **Push Off:** As you push off, start to twist your body to one side. This will position you onto your side or stomach, ready to swim.

4. **Streamline:** Extend into a streamlined position, just below the surface of the water.

5. **Glide & Swim:** Kick off into a glide, then break into your freestyle stroke. 

Practice this sequence until it becomes fluid and you can seamlessly transition from the turn into swimming.

### 5. Mastering the Breath

One critical aspect of flip turns is breath control. You should exhale through your nose during the turn to avoid water rushing up it.

 

**Exercise:**

1. **Approach:** As before, swim towards the wall.

2. **Exhale:** As you begin your somersault, start to exhale slowly through your nose. Continue exhaling as you flip and push off the wall.

3. **Push, Twist, and Swim:** Push off, twist, extend into a streamline, glide, and start swimming as usual, taking a breath as needed once you've started stroking.

### 6. Timing

The last aspect is the timing of your flip turn. You want to start your turn so that your feet land on the wall just below the surface.

**Exercise:**

1. **Approach:** Swim towards the wall, judging the distance for your flip.

2. **Start the Flip:** Begin your somersault at the right time so your feet land on the wall just below the surface.

3. **Push, Twist, and Swim:** Complete your flip turn as before, pushing off, twisting, extending, gliding, and resuming swimming.

## Additional Tips

1. **Use your core:** Your abs should be doing most of the work during the flip. If your neck is sore, you're likely not using your core enough.

2. **Streamline:** Remember to keep your body as streamlined as possible during the push-off and glide to maximize efficiency and speed.

3. **Practice:** Flip turns can be tricky at first. Practice is key to mastering the timing and technique.
