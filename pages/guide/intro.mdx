This guide only acts as an overview to swimming and can help improve in some of the
areas that one might struggle with. However, it's important to note that even though I'm an experienced swimmer,
I'm not responsible for any incidents that may occur while swimming.

### Importance of Swimming Lessons

While this guide can provide valuable information, nothing compares to the benefits of taking swimming lessons from a qualified instructor. A swim instructor is trained and experienced in teaching swimming techniques, safety practices, and correct form. They can provide personalized instruction, identify areas for improvement, and offer guidance to help you progress faster and more effectively.
