# Swimming Etiquette

Swimming is a fantastic activity that promotes health, fitness, and enjoyment for all ages. However, to make sure everyone has a good time, make sure to follow this etiquette:

### Basic Swimming Etiquette

- **Respect Others:** Always be aware of other swimmers around you and try to avoid getting in their way. Try to be aware of the space around you and avoid taking up too much room with your arms and legs.

- **Shower Before Entering the Pool:** To maintain the cleanliness of the pool, it's essential to shower before entering. Showering removes any dirt or impurities from your body, preventing them from contaminating the pool water. It helps keep the pool clean and makes swimming more enjoyable for everyone.

- **No Running or Rough Play:** Running or engaging in rough play is not permitted as it can be dangerous and disruptive to others.

- **Use Appropriate Swimwear:** Make sure your swimwear is clean and suitable for a public place.

- **No Diving in Shallow Water:** Make sure the water is deep enough before diving to avoid getting hurt. There's a reason why there are signs that say "No Diving" in shallow water.

- **Avoid Wearing Perfume or Cologne:** Strong-smelling perfumes or colognes can be bothersome to some swimmers, particularly those with allergies or respiratory issues.

- **Don't Urinate in the Pool:** Of course, please don't pee in the pool. It's unhygienic and unpleasant for everyone. It's gross and can irritate the eyes and skin of other swimmers, which is extremely unpleasant.

### Lane Swimming Etiquette

- **Remaining Calm and Considerate:** It's important to remain calm and considerate towards other swimmers in the lane. Don't splash excessively, cut off other swimmers, or swim too close to them. It's important to be considerate. Maintain a respectful distance and be mindful of your actions to ensure a positive swimming experience for everyone in the lane.

- **Choose the Right Lane:** Lanes are often divided by speed. Select a lane that matches your swimming speed. Check the lane speeds before getting in the pool and choose the one that matches your swimming speed.

- **Circle Swimming:** In a crowded lane, swimmers should swim in a counter-clockwise circle. Additionally, try to swim alongside the lane rope rather than down the middle of the lane.

- **Passing:** If you need to pass someone, do so on the left side. Make sure the lane is clear before you pass someone. If someone is trying to pass you, move towards the lane rope and let them pass.

- **Resting:** If you need to rest, move to the side of the lane, out of the way of other swimmers. If you need to rest, move to the side of the lane and avoid staying there for too long.

- **Entering and Exiting:** Before entering or exiting a lane, be aware of other swimmers. Enter the water gently, either by stepping in slowly or by performing a quiet dive.

- **Turn at the End of the Lane:** When turning at the end of the lane, try to move over to the other side of the lane as you approach. That way, you won't bump into anyone swimming right behind you.
