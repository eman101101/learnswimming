## Swimming Etiquette

Swimming is a fantastic activity that promotes health, fitness, and enjoyment for all ages. However, to ensure everyone's safety and pleasure, it's crucial to adhere to certain etiquette rules. Here are some fundamental rules to follow:

### Basic Swimming Etiquette

- **Respect Others:** Always be aware of other swimmers around you and try to avoid getting in their way. Be mindful of the space you're taking up and avoid spreading out your arms and legs too much when swimming.

- **Shower Before Entering the Pool:** To maintain the cleanliness of the pool, it's essential to shower before entering. Showering removes any dirt or impurities from your body, preventing them from contaminating the pool water. This not only keeps the pool cleaner but also ensures a more pleasant swimming experience for everyone.

- **No Running or Rough Play:** Running or engaging in rough play is not permitted as it can be dangerous and disruptive to others.

- **Use Appropriate Swimwear:** Make sure your swimwear is clean, in good condition, and suitable for a public place.

- **No Diving in Shallow Water:** Always check the depth of the water before diving to avoid injuries.

- **Avoid Wearing Perfume or Cologne:** Strong-smelling perfumes or colognes can be bothersome to some swimmers, particularly those with allergies or respiratory issues.

- **Don't Urinate in the Pool:** It goes without saying, but please refrain from urinating in the pool. It's unhygienic and can irritate the eyes and skin of other swimmers, which is extremely unpleasant.

### Lane Swimming Etiquette

- **Remaining Calm and Considerate:** It's important to remain calm and considerate towards other swimmers in the lane. Avoid aggressive behavior such as excessive splashing, cutting off other swimmers, or intentionally swimming too close to others. Maintain a respectful distance and be mindful of your actions to ensure a positive and harmonious swimming experience for everyone in the lane.

- **Choose the Right Lane:** Lanes are often divided by speed. Select a lane that matches your swimming speed. Before jumping into the pool, check if the lanes have designated speeds and position yourself accordingly with the speed of other swimmers already in those lanes.

- **Circle Swimming:** In a crowded lane, swimmers should swim in a counter-clockwise circle. Additionally, try to swim alongside the lane rope rather than down the middle of the lane.

- **Passing:** If you need to pass someone, do so on the left side. Ensure the lane is clear before starting to pass. If someone is trying to pass you, move towards the lane rope and let them pass.

- **Resting:** If you need to rest, move to the side of the lane, out of the way of other swimmers. Avoid sitting on the wall or the lane for an extended period.

- **Entering and Exiting:** Before entering or exiting a lane, be aware of other swimmers. Enter the water gently, either by stepping in slowly or by performing a quiet dive.

- **Turn at the End of the Lane:** When turning at the end of the lane, try to move over to the other side of the lane as you approach. This way, you avoid colliding with anyone who might be following closely behind.
