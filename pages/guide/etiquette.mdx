# Swimming and Lane Swimming Etiquette

Swimming is a fun and healthy activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. However, it's important to follow certain etiquette rules to ensure everyone's safety and enjoyment. Here are some basic rules to follow:

## Basic Swimming Etiquette

1. **Respect Others:** Always be aware of other swimmers around you and try to avoid getting in their way.

2. **Shower Before Entering the Pool:** This helps to keep the pool clean.

3. **No Running or Rough Play:** This can be dangerous and disruptive to others.

4. **Use Appropriate Swimwear:** Swimwear should be clean and suitable for a public place.

5. **No Diving in Shallow Water:** Always check the depth before diving.



## Lane Swimming Etiquette


1. **Choose the Right Lane:** Lanes are often divided by speed. Choose a lane that matches your swimming speed.

2. **Circle Swimming:** In a crowded lane, swimmers should swim in a counter-clockwise circle.

3. **Passing:** If you need to pass someone, do so on the left. Make sure the lane is clear before you start to pass.

4. **Resting:** If you need to rest, move to the side of the lane, out of the way of other swimmers.

5. **Entering and Exiting:** Be aware of other swimmers before you enter or exit a lane.


Remember, the key to a great swimming experience is respect and awareness of others. Happy swimming!
