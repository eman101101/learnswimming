# Stride Entry
A stride entry is a common entry technique used in swimming, especially for entering the water from the side of the pool. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform a stride entry:

Stand with your feet together at the edge of the pool, facing the water. Determine which foot you want to step forward with and keep that foot slightly ahead of the other.

Take a step forward with your lead foot so that it is slightly in front of the other foot. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, with your toes gripping the edge of the pool.

Raise your arms up and forward, in front of your body, keeping them shoulder-width apart. Your hands should be pointing towards the water, and your palms should be facing down.

Bend your knees slightly and prepare to jump forward.

Take a strong hop forward off your back foot, using your momentum to propel yourself into the air.

As you jump, lean your body forward and extend your arms out in front of you, keeping them shoulder-width apart. Keep your hands together and your fingers pointed straight ahead.

Land in the water with your arms extended out in front of you and your body in a streamlined position. Your head should be tucked in and your body should be straight and aligned with the direction of your jump.

After you enter the water, begin swimming and move your arms and legs in a coordinated motion to continue forward.

Tips:

Keep your body straight and streamlined throughout the jump and entry to minimize drag and maximize speed.
Practice your stride entry technique by starting with small hops and gradually increasing the distance and power of your jump.
Remember to breathe out as you enter the water to avoid inhaling water.
