# Stride Entries

A stride entry, also known as a stride jump or stride dive, is a common and useful technique for entering the water from the poolside or from a starting block. It's especially handy when the water is too deep to touch the bottom, but not deep enough for a head-first dive. It is also commonly used in lifeguarding and lifesaving as it allows the swimmer to enter the water without submerging completely, keeping the head above water for visibility. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to perfect your stride entries.

## Preparing for the Stride Entry

**Positioning:** Begin by standing at the edge of the pool or starting block, facing the water. Your feet should be approximately hip-width apart for good balance, and you should be close enough to the edge that your toes are hanging off slightly. 

**Body Alignment:** Stand tall with your shoulders back and your gaze straight ahead. Maintaining proper body alignment not only ensures a clean entry but also helps to prevent injuries.

### Performing the Stride Entry

**Step Forward:** Take a large step forward with one foot, keeping your other foot planted at the starting position. The foot that steps forward will depend on your personal comfort; some people prefer leading with their left foot and others with their right.

**Arm Movement:** As you step forward, swing your arms up to shoulder height in a controlled manner. Your arms should be slightly bent at the elbows, and your hands should be open with fingers together.

**The Leap:** Push off with your back foot, propelling yourself forward and away from the edge. You should be aiming for a long, shallow arc rather than a high jump. 

**Body Position:** Extend the leg you stepped forward with, pointing your toes for a streamlined shape. Your other knee should be bent, with that foot coming up towards your buttocks. This position is similar to a running stride, hence the name of the dive. Your chest should be vertical or slightly leaned forward, and your head should be neutral, maintaining visibility.

**Entering the Water:** As you're about to hit the water, extend your trailing leg to match the leading one. Your body should enter the water cleanly, creating minimal splash. Your hands can be slightly in front of you to 'part' the water, reducing impact.

### Resurfacing and Ready Position

**Resurfacing:** After entering the water, your momentum should bring you back up to the surface quickly. As you rise, kick with your legs and use your arms to steady yourself.

**Ready Position:** Once you've resurfaced, you should be in a position that allows you to start swimming immediately. Your legs should be underneath you, ready to kick, and your arms should be ready to pull.

### Tips and Safety Precautions

- Always check the depth of the water before attempting a stride entry. It should be deep enough to safely accommodate your entry without the risk of hitting the bottom.

- Practice the stride entry technique in a controlled environment, like a swimming pool, before attempting it in open water.

- It might take a few tries to get the distance and trajectory of your stride entry right. Don't be discouraged! Practice makes perfect.

- If you feel any discomfort or pain during the stride entry, stop immediately and consult with a professional.
