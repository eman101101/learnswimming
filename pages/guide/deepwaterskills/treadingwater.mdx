## Scissor Kick

The scissor kick is an essential swimming technique commonly used in the sidestroke and the breaststroke. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions to help you learn and master the scissor kick.

### Understanding the Scissor Kick

The scissor kick is a swimming technique that involves moving your legs in a sweeping motion, resembling the opening and closing of a pair of scissors.

**Key components of the scissor kick:**

- Leg movement: Legs move in an alternating sweeping motion, with one leg moving forward and the other moving backward.
- Propulsion: The legs generate propulsion by pushing water in opposite directions during the sweeping motion.
- Timing: The kick is synchronized with the arm movements in the sidestroke or breaststroke.

### Dryland Practice

Before practicing the scissor kick in the water, try performing the motion on dry land to familiarize yourself with the movement.

**Dryland exercise:**

1. Lie on your side on a mat or soft surface.
2. Bend your top leg slightly at the knee and bring it forward.
3. Extend your bottom leg straight and slightly behind you.
4. Simultaneously bring your top leg back and your bottom leg forward, keeping your legs mostly straight.
5. Return your legs to the starting position.
6. Repeat this motion several times to get comfortable with the movement.

### Pool Practice with a Kickboard

Now it's time to practice the scissor kick in the water.

**Exercise:**

1. Hold a kickboard with both hands, extending your arms in front of you.
2. Position yourself on your side, with your head resting on your bottom arm.
3. Start with your top leg slightly bent and forward, and your bottom leg extended and slightly behind you.
4. Perform the scissor kick motion, sweeping your legs apart and then bringing them back together.
5. Focus on generating propulsion with your legs and maintaining a streamlined body position.
6. Continue practicing the kick until you feel comfortable and can maintain a steady rhythm.

### Pool Practice without a Kickboard

Once you're comfortable with the scissor kick using a kickboard, try practicing without it.

**Exercise:**

1. Position yourself on your side in the water, with your head resting on your bottom arm.
2. Extend your top arm forward, in line with your body.
3. Start with your top leg slightly bent and forward, and your bottom leg extended and slightly behind you.
4. Perform the scissor kick motion, sweeping your legs apart and then bringing them back together.
5. Focus on maintaining a streamlined body position and generating propulsion with your legs.
6. Practice the kick without a kickboard until you can maintain a steady rhythm and feel comfortable with the motion.

## Treading Water Arms

Treading water is an essential swimming skill that allows you to stay afloat in one place without swimming forward. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions to help you learn and master the arm movements for treading water.

### Understanding Treading Water

Treading water involves coordinated movements of your arms and legs to create upward lift and maintain buoyancy. This guide focuses on the arm movements.

**Key components of treading water arm movements:**

- Arm motion: Arms move in a circular or sculling motion, pushing water downward.
- Buoyancy: Arm movements help create upward lift to counteract the body's natural tendency to sink.
- Coordination: Arm movements should be coordinated with leg movements, such as the eggbeater kick or flutter kick.

### Dryland Practice

Before practicing the arm movements for treading water in the pool, try performing the motion on dry land to familiarize yourself with the movement.

**Dryland exercise:**

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and bend your knees slightly.
2. Extend your arms to the sides, bending your elbows at a 90-degree angle.
3. Move your hands in a circular motion, as if you were pushing water downward.
4. Practice this motion several times to get comfortable with the movement.

### Pool Practice – Shallow Water

Begin practicing the arm movements for treading water in shallow water where you can stand comfortably.

**Exercise:**

1. Stand in shallow water with your feet flat on the pool floor.
2. Bend your knees slightly and lift your feet off the ground, allowing your body to float.
3. Perform the circular arm motion you practiced on dry land, pushing water downward to create upward lift.
4. Focus on keeping your head above water and maintaining a steady rhythm with your arm movements.
5. Continue practicing until you feel comfortable and can maintain your position in the water.

### Pool Practice – Deep Water

Once you're comfortable with the arm movements in shallow water, move to deeper water where you can't touch the bottom.

**Exercise:**

1. Start in a vertical position in deep water, with your arms at your sides.
2. Perform the circular arm motion, pushing water downward to create upward lift.
3. Keep your head above water and maintain a steady rhythm with your arm movements.
4. Continue practicing until you can tread water using only your arms for an extended period.

## Complete Treading Water

Once you have learned the scissor kick and treading water arms, you are well on your way to mastering the art of treading water. This guide will help you combine these skills to stay afloat in one place without swimming forward.

### Combining Scissor Kick and Treading Water Arms

Treading water requires a coordinated effort from both your arms and legs. The scissor kick and treading water arms provide the foundation for maintaining buoyancy and balance while you stay afloat.

**Key components of treading water:**

- Synchronization: Coordinate your scissor kick with the treading water arm movements to keep your head above water and maintain balance.
- Body position: Keep your body upright and maintain a steady rhythm with your arm and leg movements.

### Practising in Shallow Water

Begin practicing treading water in shallow water where you can stand comfortably.

**Exercise:**

1. Stand in shallow water with your feet flat on the pool floor.
2. Bend your knees slightly and lift your feet off the ground, allowing your body to float.
3. Start performing the scissor kick motion while simultaneously moving your arms in the treading water arm motion.
4. Focus on coordinating your arm and leg movements, generating upward lift to keep your head above water.
5. Continue practicing until you feel comfortable and can maintain your position in the water.

### Practising in Deep Water

Once you're comfortable with treading water in shallow water, move to deeper water where you can't touch the bottom.

**Exercise:**

1. Start in a vertical position in deep water, with your arms at your sides.
2. Perform the scissor kick motion while simultaneously moving your arms in the treading water arm motion.
3. Keep your head above water and maintain a steady rhythm with your arm and leg movements.
4. Continue practicing until you can tread water for an extended period.

### Enhancing Stability and Endurance

After mastering the basics of treading water, focus on improving your stability and endurance.

**Tips for enhancing stability and endurance:**

1. Experiment with different leg kicks, such as the eggbeater kick or frog kick, to find the most comfortable and efficient method for you.
2. Adjust the speed and intensity of your arm and leg movements to conserve energy while maintaining buoyancy.
3. Practice treading water for longer durations to build endurance and confidence in your skills.


## Treading Water Drills

Understanding the Hand Movement: The first step in treading water is to understand how your hands should move. Imagine your hands as the blades of a fan, creating downward pressure in the water. Practice this motion in shallow water, feeling the water against the palms of your hands as you move them back and forth.

Sitting Down in Water: Next, sit down in the water while continuing to work your arms. As you sit, try lifting your feet off the bottom of the pool periodically. You may need to quicken the pace of your hands for a few seconds at a time to maintain your balance.

Leg Movement: The leg movement used in treading water is known as the eggbeater kick. It involves a rhythmic, alternating circular motion of the legs that helps to keep you afloat. Practice this motion in shallow water before moving to deeper water.

Combining Arms and Legs: Once you're comfortable with the arm and leg movements, it's time to combine them. Start in neck-deep water and practice moving your arms and legs together. Remember, slow and smooth motions are more effective than fast and stiff ones.

Practicing in Deep Water: When you feel ready, you can finally head to the deep end to practice treading water. Start with one arm along with your kick, and then add the other arm. Always stay within arm's reach of the wall for safety.
