# Treading Water

Treading water is an essential skill that allows you to stay afloat in one place without swimming forward. It's an extremely important safety skill and is a crucial skill to master as a lifesaving skill.

Make sure to learn the Scissor kick before starting this guide which is used for the leg movements for treading water. [Scissor Kick Guide](../../../guide/basicskills/scissorkick.mdx).

You can also use the eggbeater kick as a more advanced alternative. It's more difficult to learn, but once you master it your treading becomes a much more efficent kick. [Eggbeater Guide](../../../guide/advancedskills/eggbeater.mdx).

## Treading Water Arms

- Start by standing in chest-deep water or a comfortable depth where you can maintain an upright position. Keep your body vertical with your head above the water's surface. Relax your shoulders and maintain a natural posture.

- Extend your arms in front of you, keeping them slightly bent at the elbows. 

- Slighty Cup your hands and create a slight resistance by keeping your fingers together. 

- Begin moving your hands back and forth. This motion creates lift and helps you maintain balance and stability while treading water.

- Move your arms in small, controlled circles in opposite directions. This motion is what generates momentum and helps you stay afloat.

## Complete Treading Water

- Start in a vertical position in deep water, with your arms at your sides.

- Perform the scissor kick motion while simultaneously moving your arms in the treading water arm motion.

- Keep your head above water and maintain a steady rhythm with your arm and leg movements.

- Continue practicing until you can tread water for an extended period. Start with small intervals and gradually increase the amount of time you can tread water.

### Maintaining Balance and Buoyancy

Treading water requires a combination of balance and buoyancy. The goal is to keep your head above water while maintaining a vertical position in the water.

**Tips for maintaining balance and buoyancy:**

- Keep your head above water and your body vertical. Try to keep your chin up and avoid leaning your head back too much, as it can cause your legs to sink.

- Relax your shoulders and maintain a natural posture. Focus on keeping your shoulders relaxed and down, allowing your arms to move freely. Tensing up can lead to unnecessary strain and fatigue, making it harder to maintain buoyancy.

- Keep your arms and legs moving in a steady rhythm. Find a rhythm that works for you and maintain a steady pace without exhausting yourself too much.
