# Treading Water
Treading water is an important skill to learn for any swimmer, as it allows you to stay afloat and conserve energy without actually moving through the water. Here's how to do it:


**Section 1: Learning the Scissor Kick**

1. **Start in Shallow Water:** Begin in a part of the pool where you can touch the bottom. This way, if you start to sink, you can easily stand up.

2. **Understand the Motion:** The scissor kick involves moving your legs back and forth in a scissor-like motion. One leg moves forward while the other moves backward, and then they switch.

3. **Practice the Kick:** While keeping your body upright, practice the scissor kick. Try to keep your kicks under the water and your body as vertical as possible.

**Section 2: Treading Arms**

1. **Understand the Motion:** Your arms should stay under the water, moving in a horizontal sculling motion. This means moving your arms back and forth, similar to the way a bird flaps its wings.

2. **Practice the Motion:** While standing in the shallow end, practice this motion with your arms. Remember to keep your movements smooth and controlled.

**Section 3: Complete Treading Water**

1. **Combine Legs and Arms:** Now, try to combine the scissor kick with the arm movements. This might take some coordination, but with practice, you'll get the hang of it.

2. **Practice Breathing:** While treading water, you should be able to breathe normally. If you find yourself out of breath, it's a sign that you're working too hard and need to relax more.

3. **Move to Deeper Water:** Once you're comfortable treading water in the shallow end, gradually move to deeper water. Always have someone with you for safety.

**Section 4: Learning the Eggbeater**

1. **Understand the Motion:** The eggbeater kick involves moving your legs in opposite circular motions, similar to how an eggbeater works.

2. **Practice the Kick:** Start by practicing this kick in the shallow end. Remember to keep your body upright and your movements controlled.

3. **Combine with Arm Movements:** Once you're comfortable with the eggbeater kick, combine it with the arm movements you learned earlier. This is a more advanced technique and can help you tread water more efficiently.

**Safety Tips:**
- Never swim alone. Always have a buddy or a lifeguard present.
- Don't panic if you start to sink. Stand up if you're in the shallow end or swim to the side if you're in the deep end.
- Take breaks when you need to. Treading water can be tiring, especially when you're just learning.
