# Dives
Diving is a common entry technique used in competitive swimming events, and is a bit more advanced than a stride entry. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform a dive:

Stand at the end of the diving board with your toes gripping the edge of the board. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, with your toes pointing straight ahead.

Take a few deep breaths to calm yourself and focus your mind on the upcoming dive.

Raise your arms up and forward, in front of your body, keeping them shoulder-width apart. Your hands should be pointing towards the end of the board, and your palms should be facing down.

Take a small hop forward with your feet to initiate your jump.

As you jump, lift your legs up behind you and lean your body forward, keeping your arms extended out in front of you. Keep your head down and tucked in towards your chest.

Tuck your body into a tight ball as you near the end of the board, with your knees tucked up towards your chest and your arms wrapped around your legs.

Propel yourself off the end of the board by springing your legs forward, and extend your arms and legs outward to streamline your body as you enter the water.

Aim to enter the water at a slight angle, with your head, arms, and legs all pointing in the same direction.

After you enter the water, begin swimming and move your arms and legs in a coordinated motion to continue forward.

Tips:

Practice your dive technique on a lower diving board or a pool deck before attempting it on a higher board.
Keep your body straight and streamlined throughout the dive to minimize drag and maximize speed.
Remember to breathe out as you enter the water to avoid inhaling water.
