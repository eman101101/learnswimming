# Surface Dives
Head-First Surface Dive:

1. Preparation: Begin by swimming or floating on the surface of the water, facing the direction you want to dive. Take a deep breath and ensure your mask or goggles are secure.

2. Streamline position: Bring your arms together above your head in a streamlined position, with your hands clasped together and your biceps close to your ears. This position will help you move smoothly through the water.

3. Submerging: While maintaining the streamlined position, bend at the waist and start to angle your upper body downwards. As your head and chest begin to submerge, kick your legs to propel yourself further underwater.

4. Equalizing pressure: As you descend, you may experience pressure in your ears. To equalize this pressure, pinch your nose and gently blow against it while keeping your mouth closed. This will help to open the Eustachian tubes and relieve any discomfort.

5. Descent: Continue to kick your legs and use your arms to guide yourself deeper into the water. Maintain the streamlined position for as long as possible to maximize your depth.

6. Resurfacing: When you're ready to return to the surface, extend your arms above your head and kick your legs to propel yourself upwards. As you ascend, exhale slowly to prevent any pressure buildup in your ears.

Feet-First Surface Dive:

1. Preparation: Begin by floating or treading water in an upright position. Take a deep breath and ensure your mask or goggles are secure.

2. Submerging: Bend your knees and bring them close to your chest. This will cause your body to become less buoyant, allowing you to sink below the surface.

3. Sculling: As you begin to submerge, use a sculling motion with your hands to help maintain your vertical position. Sculling involves sweeping your hands back and forth in a horizontal motion, with your palms facing the direction of the sweep.

4. Equalizing pressure: Similar to the head-first surface dive, equalize the pressure in your ears by pinching your nose and gently blowing against it while keeping your mouth closed.

5. Descent: Continue to use the sculling motion with your hands and allow your body to sink deeper into the water. You can also use gentle kicks to control your descent.

6. Resurfacing: When you're ready to return to the surface, extend your arms above your head and kick your legs to propel yourself upwards. As you ascend, exhale slowly to prevent any pressure buildup in your ears.
