# Flutter Kick

The flutter kick is a fundamental element of freestyle and backstroke swimming, which when done correctly, is a powerful propellant. It involves alternating leg movements that apply pressure on the water, both upwards and downwards. The more surfaces engaged in applying pressure, the better the propulsion. The kick should originate from the hip, while the core muscles are used for propulsion. This guide will help you master the flutter kick through a drill progression.

## Mental Imagery for Kicking

**Preparation:**

1. Enter the water and hold onto the pool's edge.
2. From a standing position facing the wall, kick your legs up to the surface, making your body horizontal (parallel to the pool bottom).
3. Use your forearms and the wall to help you achieve a horizontal position, and keep your head out of the water.
4. Keep your legs long and loose (do not actively point your toes).

**Execution:**

1. Ensure you can sustain a steady rhythmic kick (speed is not important yet) that feels like you are putting pressure on the water along the length of your leg.
2. Once comfortable in the horizontal position, submerge your face in the water and extend your arms, placing your hands on the wall.
3. Continue kicking, feeling your hands being pressed toward the wall. Maintain the extended streamlined position developed in step 1.

**Focusing on propulsion:**

With proper kicking imagery and a horizontal position in the water, it's time to use your legs to manipulate and put pressure on the water. Ensure your legs are in the water, and aim to have only your heel break the surface. To verify you are performing the skill correctly, conduct a quick head-to-toe check by asking yourself the following questions:

1. Are your arms fully extended?
2. Is your core long, or are you performing a "crunching" motion?
3. Is your pelvis tucked under, causing your feet to sink?
4. Do you feel the effort in your glutes and upper thighs, indicating that you're using your entire leg and core? Or do you feel it in your quads, near your knees, indicating that you're using only your lower legs?
5. Are your ankles stiff or loose? Loose is preferable.
