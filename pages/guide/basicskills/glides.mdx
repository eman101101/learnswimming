# Glides

Learning how to glide is an essential skill in swimming as it allows swimmers to move smoothly and efficiently through the water without relying on arm or leg movements for propulsion. Gliding helps develop body position, balance, and streamlining, which are fundamental for effective swimming strokes and overall aquatic proficiency. By practicing gliding, swimmers can enhance their ability to maintain momentum and control their movements in the water.

## Front Glide

### Stand in Waist-Deep Water with Arms Extended in Front

Stand in waist-deep water with your arms stretched out in front of you. Take a deep breath and prepare for the glide.

### Push Off and Maintain a Horizontal Body Position

### Extend Your Arms and Keep Your Legs Together

Extend your arms forward, bringing your hands together, and keep your legs straight and close together. Glide forward, utilizing the momentum from your push-off, and maintain gentle leg kicks to sustain your forward motion.

## Back Glide

### Stand in Waist-Deep Water with Arms Extended to the Sides

Stand in waist-deep water with your arms extended out to the sides, palms facing up. Take a deep breath and prepare for the glide.
