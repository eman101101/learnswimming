# Glides

Learning how to glide is an essential skill in swimming as it allows swimmers to move smoothly and efficiently through the water without any propulsion from arm or leg movements. Gliding helps develop body position, balance, and streamlining, which are fundamental for effective swimming strokes and overall aquatic proficiency. By practicing gliding, swimmers can enhance their ability to maintain momentum and control their movements in the water.
## Front Glide

### Stand in waist-deep water with arms extended in front

Stand in waist-deep water with your arms stretched out in front of you. Take a deep breath and prepare for the glide.

### Push off and keep your body horizontal

Push off from the wall, using your legs to propel you forward. Keep your body straight and horizontal with your head down and face in the water.

### Extend your arms and keep your legs together

Extend your arms forward with your hands together and keep your legs straight and close together. Glide forward using the momentum from your push-off and continue to kick your legs gently to maintain your forward motion.
