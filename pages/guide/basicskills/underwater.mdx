## Getting Comfortable Underwater

### Start with small steps

Start by putting your face in the water and blowing bubbles. Do this at the shallow end of the pool or while standing in the water. This exercise will help you gradually get comfortable with having your face in the water. You can also try putting your whole head underwater and holding your breath for a few seconds. Take your time and gradually increase the amount of time you spend with your face in the water.

### Practice breathing and staying calm

Before you go underwater, take a deep breath and hold it. Then, when you're ready, exhale slowly through your nose or mouth as you go underwater. This will help you stay calm and in control while swimming. Practice breathing in and out while your face is in the water, and try to take slow, deep breaths. This will improve your lung capacity and overall comfort in the water.

### Practice opening your eyes underwater

Once you become more comfortable with having your face in the water, you can start practicing opening your eyes underwater. This is an important skill for swimming without goggles or in case your goggles become loose or come off while swimming. Start by submerging your face in the water and gradually open your eyes. It might feel a bit strange at first, but with practice, you'll get used to it. Try looking around underwater and focusing on objects to improve your visual acuity without goggles.

### Use goggles as a confidence booster

Wearing goggles can help you see underwater and make you feel more comfortable while practicing swimming. Goggles create a clear and distortion-free vision, allowing you to enjoy your time in the water without worrying about irritation or blurry vision. They also provide a layer of protection for your eyes. Experiment with different types of goggles to find ones that fit comfortably and don't leak. Make sure to adjust the straps properly to achieve a snug fit that keeps water out.

### Dealing with loose goggles

Sometimes, goggles can become loose while swimming, which can be distracting and uncomfortable. If you notice your goggles becoming loose, try to find a convenient time to adjust them without interrupting your swim. You can stop at the wall or take a quick break at the pool's edge to tighten the straps and readjust the position of the goggles. This will ensure a better fit and prevent water from leaking in.
