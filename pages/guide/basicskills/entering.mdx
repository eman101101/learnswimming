## Entering the water

### Introduction
When starting out as a beginner swimmer, it's crucial to prioritize safety and confidence-building. Mastering the basics of entering the water safely can prevent accidents and ensure a positive swimming experience. In this guide, we will cover essential steps for safe water entry, helping you become more comfortable in the aquatic environment.

### Finding a Safe Entry Point
Before entering the water, it's important to identify a suitable entry point that ensures your safety. Depending on the location, here are some guidelines to consider:

#### Beaches
If you're at a beach, locate a lifeguard tower and choose an entry point near it. Lifeguard towers indicate areas of the beach that have been deemed safe for swimming.

#### Lakes
When swimming in a lake, look for a designated swimming area. These areas are typically demarcated by buoys or signs and are regularly monitored to ensure safety.

#### Pools
In a pool setting, it's advisable to start at the shallow end. This area allows for a gradual transition into deeper water and helps build confidence in a controlled environment.

###  Adopting a Feet-First Entry
For a safe water entry, always enter feet-first. Whether you're using a ladder or wading in from the beach, avoid jumping in until you feel more comfortable in the water. By going feet-first, you minimize the risk of head or neck injuries, especially when uncertain about water depth.

### Gradually Entering the Water
To avoid a sudden shock to your body, it's important to enter the water gradually. Take your time and follow these steps:

1. Use a gradual approach: Begin by slowly walking into the water, allowing your body to acclimate to the changing temperature.
2. Splash water on your face and body: Before fully submerging, splash some water on your face and body. This helps your body adjust to the water temperature and reduces the shock when you eventually go underwater.

By entering the water gradually, you give yourself time to adapt and feel more comfortable in the aquatic environment.
