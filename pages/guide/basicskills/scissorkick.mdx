# Scissor Kick

## Learning Scissor Kick

The scissor kick is a powerful and versatile swimming technique that involves a simultaneous scissor-like motion of the legs. It is commonly used in various swimming strokes, such as freestyle, butterfly, and backstroke. This guide will help you master the scissor kick through a step-by-step progression.

**1. Body Position and Alignment**

Before focusing on the scissor kick itself, it's essential to establish a proper body position and alignment in the water. Follow these steps:

1. Start in a horizontal position with your body parallel to the pool bottom.
2. Keep your head aligned with your spine, looking down at the bottom of the pool.
3. Maintain a straight and streamlined body from head to toe.
4. Engage your core muscles to stabilize your body.

**Leg Movements and Technique**

Once you have a solid body position, it's time to learn the scissor kick technique. Follow these steps:

1. Begin with your legs extended and close together.
2. Simultaneously move your legs apart in a scissor-like motion, one leg moving forward and the other moving backward.
3. As your legs reach the maximum extension, quickly reverse the motion, bringing the forward leg backward and the backward leg forward.
4. Focus on generating power from your hips and core, driving the scissor kick motion.
5. Keep your legs relatively straight with a slight knee bend.
6. Point your toes slightly to increase surface area and propulsion.
7. Maintain a steady and continuous scissor kick rhythm throughout your swim stroke.

## Improving Scissor Kick

Here are some tips to improve your scissor kick technique:

1. Develop Proper Body Alignment and Position: Pay attention to your body's alignment in the water. Keep your body horizontal and streamline your body position to minimize drag. Extend your arms forward and keep your head aligned with your spine, looking straight down. Maintaining a streamlined body position will help optimize the effectiveness of your scissor kick.

2. Engage Core Muscles and Hips: The power in your scissor kick comes from engaging your core muscles and hips. Focus on strengthening your core through exercises like planks, leg raises, and rotational exercises. By activating your core and driving the movement from your hips, you can generate more power and efficiency in your scissor kick.

3. Maintain a Steady and Rhythmic Scissor Kick: Consistency and rhythm are essential for an effective scissor kick. Avoid jerky or erratic movements that can disrupt your stroke's flow. Aim for a smooth and rhythmic motion, keeping your kicks steady and symmetrical. This will help maintain your momentum and maximize your propulsion in the water.

4. Experiment with Angle and Amplitude: Everyone's body is different, so it's important to find the angle and amplitude of the scissor kick that works best for you. Experiment with different degrees of leg separation and the range of motion in your kick. Some swimmers may benefit from a wider scissor kick, while others may find a narrower kick more effective. Find the sweet spot that allows you to generate power and maintain balance and stability in the water.

5. Incorporate Scissor Kick Drills: Including specific scissor kick drills in your regular swimming workouts can help you refine your technique and strengthen the muscles involved. Examples of scissor kick drills include kicking on your back with your arms extended, using a kickboard for added resistance, or incorporating scissor kick sets into your interval training. Consistent practice and drill work will enhance your scissor kick proficiency.

6. Gradually Increase Speed and Power: Mastering the scissor kick takes time and practice. Start by focusing on the fundamentals and gradually increase the speed and power of your kick as you become more comfortable and proficient. Push yourself to improve but do so gradually to avoid sacrificing technique for speed. With patience and persistence, your scissor kick will become stronger and more efficient over time.

Remember, mastering any swimming technique, including the scissor kick, requires dedication, consistent practice, and attention to detail. By implementing these tips and incorporating them into your training routine, you can enhance your scissor kick and improve your overall swimming performance.

## Scissor Kick Drills

To enhance your scissor kick technique and build strength, incorporate the following drills into your practice sessions:

### Drill 1: Scissor Kick on the Wall

1. Stand facing the pool wall with your arms extended and your hands holding onto the wall.
2. Kick your legs in a scissor motion, focusing on proper technique and maintaining a steady rhythm.
3. Feel the pressure on the water created by the scissor kick.
4. Gradually increase the speed and power of your kicks while maintaining control and balance.

### Drill 2: Scissor Kick with a Kickboard

1. Hold a kickboard out in front of you with your arms extended.
2. Start kicking with the scissor kick motion, using the kickboard for buoyancy and balance.
3. Focus on generating power and propulsion with each scissor kick.
4. Experiment with different hand positions on the kickboard to find what feels most comfortable and effective.

### Drill 3: Scissor Kick Swim

1. Incorporate the scissor kick into your swimming strokes.
2. Start with a stroke, such as freestyle or butterfly, and emphasize the scissor kick motion while maintaining proper technique.
3. Coordinate your arm movements with the scissor kick to achieve a smooth and efficient swimming motion.
