# Flutter Kick

Having great front crawl and back crawl requires placing a strong emphasis on perfecting your flutter kick. The kick provides swimmers with stability, balance, and the necessary propulsion to maintain a streamlined body position and generate forward momentum. By prioritizing a solid kicking technique before starting front or back crawl, it will make learning the strokes much easier and more efficient.

## Learning Flutter Kick

The more surfaces engaged in applying pressure, the better the propulsion. The kick should originate from the hip, while the core muscles are used for propulsion. This guide will help you master the flutter kick through a drill progression.

**Preparation:**

1. Enter the water and hold onto the pool's edge.
2. From a standing position facing the wall, kick your legs up to the surface, making your body horizontal (parallel to the pool bottom).
3. Use your forearms and the wall to help you achieve a horizontal position, and keep your head out of the water.
4. Keep your legs long and loose (do not actively point your toes).

**Execution:**

1. Ensure you can sustain a steady rhythmic kick (speed is not important yet) that feels like you are putting pressure on the water along the length of your leg.
2. Once comfortable in the horizontal position, submerge your face in the water and extend your arms, placing your hands on the wall.
3. Continue kicking, feeling your hands being pressed toward the wall. Maintain the extended streamlined position developed in step 1.

**Focusing on propulsion:**

With proper kicking imagery and a horizontal position in the water, it's time to use your legs to manipulate and put pressure on the water. Ensure your legs are in the water, and aim to have only your heel break the surface. To verify you are performing the skill correctly, conduct a quick head-to-toe check by asking yourself the following questions:

Are your arms fully extended?

Is your core long, or are you performing a "crunching" motion?

Is your pelvis tucked under, causing your feet to sink?

Do you feel the effort in your glutes and upper thighs, indicating that you're using your entire leg and core? Or do you feel it in your quads, near your knees, indicating that you're using only your lower legs?

Are your ankles stiff or loose? Loose is preferable.

**Fingertip Pressure Drill**

Begin a meter away from the wall and assume a streamlined position on your front in the water. Kick towards the wall using only your legs, extending your arms so that your fingertips touch the wall first. Continue kicking, feeling pressure on your fingertips, which indicates a propulsive kick.

To increase the difficulty, touch the wall using only one finger while exhaling continuously, and repeat the process.

To decrease the difficulty, grab the side of the pool and place a kickboard under your stomach to provide buoyancy.

## Using a Kickboard

Ensure your kick is propulsive by using a kickboard for balance. Place your hands on the lower corners of the board. Push off the wall, facing away from it, with your face in the water, and kick rhythmically, propelling yourself slowly down the pool. Check for correct positioning if you come to a stop or go backward.

Once you've mastered kicking with the kickboard, try kicking without it in a streamlined position. When breathing, use the same sculling motion described earlier, sweeping your hands rhythmically out and in to lift your head for a quick breath. Continue with a freestyle stroke. Master this technique before moving to flutter kicking on your back.

**To Increase Difficulty:**
- Place your hands together on the kickboard.
- Use a Pullbuoy instead of a kickboard.
- Don't use a kickboard at all.

**To Decrease Difficulty:**
- Rest your forearms on the kickboard.
- Use a swimmer's snorkel.
