# Flutter Kick

The flutter kick is a fundamental element of freestyle and backstroke swimming, which when done correctly, is a powerful propellant. It involves alternating leg movements that apply pressure on the water, both upwards and downwards. The more surfaces engaged in applying pressure, the better the propulsion. The kick should originate from the hip, while the core muscles are used for propulsion. This guide will help you master the flutter kick through a drill progression.

## Mental Imagery for Kicking

**Preparation:**

1. Enter the water and hold onto the pool's edge.
2. From a standing position facing the wall, kick your legs up to the surface, making your body horizontal (parallel to the pool bottom).
3. Use your forearms and the wall to help you achieve a horizontal position, and keep your head out of the water.
4. Keep your legs long and loose (do not actively point your toes).

**Execution:**

1. Ensure you can sustain a steady rhythmic kick (speed is not important yet) that feels like you are putting pressure on the water along the length of your leg.
2. Once comfortable in the horizontal position, submerge your face in the water and extend your arms, placing your hands on the wall.
3. Continue kicking, feeling your hands being pressed toward the wall. Maintain the extended streamlined position developed in step 1.

**Focusing on propulsion:**

With proper kicking imagery and a horizontal position in the water, it's time to use your legs to manipulate and put pressure on the water. Ensure your legs are in the water, and aim to have only your heel break the surface. To verify you are performing the skill correctly, conduct a quick head-to-toe check by asking yourself the following questions:

1. Are your arms fully extended?
2. Is your core long, or are you performing a "crunching" motion?
3. Is your pelvis tucked under, causing your feet to sink?
4. Do you feel the effort in your glutes and upper thighs, indicating that you're using your entire leg and core? Or do you feel it in your quads, near your knees, indicating that you're using only your lower legs?
5. Are your ankles stiff or loose? Loose is preferable.

## Swimming Guide: Kicking Drill 1 - Fingertip Pressure

Begin a yard (meter) away from the wall and assume a streamlined position on your front in the water. Kick towards the wall using only your legs, extending your arms so that your fingertips touch the wall first. Continue kicking, feeling pressure on your fingertips, which indicates a propulsive kick.

**To Increase Difficulty:**
- Touch the wall with only one finger.
- Exhale the entire time and repeat.

**To Decrease Difficulty:**
- Grab the gutter.
- Place a kickboard under your stomach for buoyancy.

**Success Check:**
- You can stay at the wall.
- You can almost feel the water rolling down your leg and off your toes.

**Score Your Success:**
- 1 point: You can stay on the wall but need to use the gutter.
- 3 points: You can push your fingers into the wall for 5 or fewer seconds.
- 5-7 points: You can push your fingers into the wall for more than 10 seconds.

## Kicking Drill 2 - Kickboard

Ensure your kick is propulsive by using a kickboard for balance. Place your hands on the lower corners of the board. Push off the wall, facing away from it, with your face in the water, and kick rhythmically, propelling yourself slowly down the pool. Check for correct positioning if you come to a stop or go backward.

Once you've mastered kicking with the kickboard, try kicking without it in a streamlined position. When breathing, use the same sculling motion described earlier, sweeping your hands rhythmically out and in to lift your head for a quick breath. Continue with a freestyle stroke. Master this technique before moving to flutter kicking on your back.

**Success Check:**
- You can travel the pool length without big splashes.
- You can turn your head to the side to breathe.

**Score Your Success:**
- 1 point: You can go half the pool length with your arms on the kickboard.
- 3 points: You can go half the pool length with just your hands on the kickboard.
- 5-7 points: You can easily go the whole pool length with just your hands.

**To Increase Difficulty:**
- Place your hands together on the kickboard.
- Use a less stable pull buoy instead of a kickboard.
- Don't use a kickboard at all.

**To Decrease Difficulty:**
- Rest your forearms on the kickboard.
- Use a swimmer's snorkel.

## Flutter Kicking on Your Back

Flutter kicking on your back differs slightly from kicking on your front. Develop an effective mental image of kicking a soccer ball floating on water with the top of your foot. Keep your legs long and loose, and ensure your toes just break the surface. Avoid big splashes for effective propulsion.

**Drills for Kicking Without a Kickboard**

These drills will help you develop kicking proficiency without relying on equipment:

1. Kicking on Your Back or Your Front
   - Master propulsive flutter kicking on your back, then try it on your front. When breathing, rotate your head to the side as with the kickboard drill.

2. Underwater Kicking
   - Practice kicking on a streamline underwater, applying pressure on the water with both the tops and bottoms of your legs and feet. Never engage in extended breath-holding, and always exhale slowly.
