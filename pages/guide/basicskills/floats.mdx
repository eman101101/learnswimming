# Floats

Learning front and back floats is important as they help beginners develop a sense of buoyancy, body awareness, and breath control in the water. Mastering these foundational skills provides a solid basis for further swimming techniques such as kicking, arm movements, and eventually full strokes.

## Front Float

### Find a Shallow Area of the Pool

Locate a shallow area of the pool where you can comfortably practice floating without touching the bottom. Take a deep breath before starting.

### Push Off and Extend Your Arms Forward

Push off from the side of the pool and extend your arms forward while lifting your legs behind you. Keep your head down and your face in the water.

### Stretch Your Arms Out in Front of You

Stretch your arms out in front of you and keep your legs straight with your toes pointed. Try to maintain a straight line with your body.

### Use Your Core Muscles to Maintain Buoyancy

Engage your core muscles to help you maintain balance and stay afloat. Focus on relaxing your body while maintaining your position.

## Back Float

### Find a Shallow Area of the Pool

Find a shallow area of the pool where you can comfortably practice floating away from other people. Take a deep breath before starting.

### Push Off and Lean Back

Push off from the side of the pool and lean back while lifting your legs towards the water's surface.

### Extend Your Arms Out to the Sides

Extend your arms out to the sides with your palms facing up. Keep your elbows straight and your fingers slightly spread apart.

### Keep Your Head Back and Face Up

Keep your head back and your face up towards the sky. Relax your neck and try to keep your ears submerged in the water.

### Use Your Core Muscles to Maintain Buoyancy

Relax your body as much as possible and use your core muscles to maintain balance and stay afloat. Keep your legs and arms still.

### Breathe In and Out

To breathe, inhale through your nose and mouth, then exhale through your mouth. Take deep, slow breaths and focus on staying as relaxed as possible.
