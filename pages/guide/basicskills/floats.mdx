# Floats
Learning front and back float is crucial in swimming instruction as it helps beginners develop a sense of buoyancy, body awareness, and breath control in the water. Mastering these foundational skills provides a solid basis for further swimming techniques such as kicking, arm movements, and eventually, full strokes.
## Front Float

<Steps>

### Find a shallow part of the pool

Find a shallow part of the pool where you can comfortably practice floating without touching the bottom. Take a deep breath before starting.

### Push off and extend your arms forward

Push off from the side of the pool and extend your arms forward while lifting your legs behind you. Keep your head down and your face in the water.

### Stretch your arms out in front of you

Stretch your arms out in front of you and keep your legs straight with your toes pointed. Try to keep your body in a straight line.

### Use your core muscles to stay afloat

Use your core muscles to keep your balance and stay afloat. Try to relax your body as much as possible while maintaining your position.

## Back Float

<Steps>

### Find a shallow part of the pool

Find a shallow part of the pool where you can comfortably practice floating away from other people. Take a deep breath before starting.

### Push off and lean back

Push off from the side of the pool and lean back while lifting your legs up towards the surface of the water.

### Extend your arms out to the sides

Extend your arms out to the sides with your palms facing up. Keep your elbows straight and your fingers slightly spread apart.

### Keep your head back and face up

Keep your head back and your face up towards the sky. Relax your neck and try to keep your ears submerged in the water.

### Use your core muscles to stay afloat

Relax your body as much as possible and use your core muscles to keep your balance and stay afloat. Keep your legs and arms still.

### Breathe in and out

To breathe, inhale through your nose and mouth, then exhale through your mouth. Take deep, slow breaths and try to stay as relaxed as possible.
