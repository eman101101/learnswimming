# Floats

Learning front and back floats is important as they help beginners develop a sense of buoyancy, body awareness, and breath control in the water. 

Mastering these foundational skills provides a solid basis for further swimming techniques such as kicking, arm movements, and eventually full strokes.Locate a shallow area of the pool where you can comfortably practice floating without touching the bottom. Take a deep breath before starting.

## Front Float

1. **Push Off and Extend Your Arms Forward**: Push off from the side of the pool and extend your arms forward while lifting your legs behind you. Keep your head down and your face in the water.

2. **Stretch Your Arms Out in Front of You**: Stretch your arms out in front of you and keep your legs straight with your toes pointed. Try to maintain a straight line with your body.

3. **Use Your Core Muscles to Maintain Buoyancy**: Engage your core muscles to help you maintain balance and stay afloat. Focus on relaxing your body while maintaining your position.

## Back Float

1. **Push Off and Lean Back**: Push off from the side of the pool and lean back while lifting your legs towards the water's surface.

2. **Extend Your Arms Out to the Sides**: Extend your arms out to the sides with your palms facing up. Keep your elbows straight and your fingers slightly spread apart.

3. **Keep Your Head Back and Face Up**: Keep your head back and your face up towards the sky. Relax your neck and try to keep your ears submerged in the water.

4. **Use Your Core Muscles to Maintain Buoyancy**: Relax your body as much as possible and use your core muscles to maintain balance and stay afloat. Keep your legs and arms still.

5. **Breathe In and Out**: To breathe, inhale through your nose and mouth, then exhale through your mouth. Take deep, slow breaths and focus on staying as relaxed as possible.
